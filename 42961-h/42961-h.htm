<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop4-o.jpg" width="232" height="182" alt="O"/>
</div>
<div class='drop-cap'>ONCE upon a time there lived
a good Judge in an old New
England town. People said
the reason that he was so
good was because his father
was a minister. But he may have gotten his
goodness from his mother. I don't know. Or
he may have had it from his uncle who took him
into his family and sent him to college. For the
minister was poor, and like many of his brethren
he had a big family; so his brother who was a
rich lawyer and a statesman helped his nephew
get his education.</div>

<p>Now, this son of a minister and nephew of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
great man studied law and became a Judge. He
was liked by every one who knew him. People
felt that he was an honest, noble man who had
mastered all the law books, and showed more
common sense than any other person in the State.
So they made him Judge. This man who started
poor and had to make his own way in the world
earned a great deal of money. People came to
him from all parts of the country, and sought
his advice. They put into his hands the most
important law cases. Only sometimes he would
not have anything to do with the cases that he
was asked to manage because he thought them
wrong.</p>

<p>As years went by he saved his money, and the
time came when he was ready to build a house.
The Judge had become the most honored and the
best known man in the State. He had many
friends among the great people of the land. He
enjoyed company, and was a famous host. So it
seemed well to him and his wife that they build
a house which should be large enough to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
their friends, and fine enough to satisfy the taste
of the society in which they moved.</p>

<p>The Judge was not moved by pride or a wish
to make a show. He wished to do the right
thing. Everybody said that he ought to have
the largest and the finest house in town. He
was not only a lawyer and rich, but he was deacon
in the church and the leading man in society.
He was likewise a great scholar; and many people
said that he was the most eloquent speaker of
his State. Such a person must live in a generous
way. So the Judge built this house.</p>

<p>Now, when it came to drawing plans the wife
had a good deal to say about it; for the house
was to be her home just as much as his; and he
always tried to do what he knew was for the
pleasure of his wife. "I think," said she when
they began to talk about building, "that it
should have a great many closets." Had you
been a friend of Mrs. "Judge" you would have
seen why she said this. She was not only a
woman who liked to have all her friends come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to visit her, but she was also very liberal and
kind. She was always doing some nice thing
for people, and always giving presents.</p>

<p>She was able to do this because she had the
things to give away. I know men and women
who would make a great many presents if they
had the money to buy them&mdash;at least they say
that they would. Such people like to tell how
they would act if they had all the money that
some neighbor has saved. They are great on
giving away things that do not belong to them.</p>

<p>Now, the Judge's wife was the best giver in
town; and she gave to her friends, and the poor,
and everybody that was in need, all sorts of
things. But in order to do this she must buy
the gifts that she scattered so freely; and when
she bought things she wanted a place to keep
them until the time came for her to give them
away. This was why she spoke to the Judge
about the closets.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said the Judge (he was always
kind and polite), "you may have just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
many closets as you wish." So she began her
plans of the house by drawing the closets. I
don't know exactly how she managed to arrange
it on paper. Very likely she said to herself, "I
shall want thirty closets." And then she would
divide the number into four parts and say, "Let
me see, I suppose that four will be enough for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the cellar. Then I shall need ten on the first
floor, and twelve on the second floor, and six in
the attic. That makes&mdash;why, that makes thirty-two.
Dear me! I wonder if that will be enough?"
And as she thinks over the various uses to which
she will put her closets, and the many things she
will store in them, she says, on the next day,
"Well, I believe that I must have five or six
more closets." So she starts her drawing by
marking down thirty-eight closets. After she has
settled it that the main floor shall have thirteen
of them, she puts upon the paper some dots
showing the size of each little room; then she
draws the other rooms about them, and so she
gets one story arranged.</p>

<p>But no sooner does she begin the plans for
the next floor, than she thinks of one or two
more closets which she needs for the first, and
so goes back to her work of yesterday, and does
it all over again, making several changes. And
so very likely the weeks are spent in making
paper closets, and drawing the halls and parlors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and bedrooms and other rooms about them, until
she puts her plans by the side of the Judge's
plans; then they get an architect; and then she
asks for four more closets, which makes forty-four.</p>

<p>After a time the men begin to build; and she
sends for the builder, and tells him of course
that she finds she will certainly need five more
closets,&mdash;one in the cellar, two on the first story,
and three on the second. He is a pleasant man;
and the changes are made. But ere the house is
half built other needs appear, and Mrs. "Judge"
insists upon three new closets, which make fifty-two.
And without doubt on the very week that
the carpenters leave the handsome mansion, she
asks them for several changes and three closets
more. And will you believe it, they move into
the new house, get nicely settled, and everything
running in good order, when the generous housewife
finds that the carpenter must come, for she
still wishes five new closets, which added to the
others make sixty. And so you have the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with sixty closets. It seems to me that I have
made it clear how there came to be so many
of these curious rooms and spaces in the Judge's
house. At least you know all that I know about
it; and I do not believe that ever another house
was built in such a way.</p>

<p>But I must tell you how the house was divided.
A plan of each story will be the best means of
fixing this in the mind; and then you can turn
back to it whenever you lose your way in the
house, and wish to get what are called "your
bearings." We must begin at the bottom and
work toward the top. The cellar was really three
cellars,&mdash;a big one, a fair-sized one, and the wine
cellar. There was a small closet in this deep,
dark place where they kept certain kinds of liquor.
The main cellar was divided lengthwise through
the middle, and there were two closets for provisions
on each side.</p>

<p>The main floor had twenty-seven closets. For
my own part, I think that woman is a remarkable
person who can invent and arrange such a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of little nooks and rooms. But if this is a mark
of genius, what shall we say when it comes to
keeping track of all the closets and their contents?
Why, I should be obliged to carry a plan of the
whole house with me, and every few minutes I
should pull it out and study it. The Judge's wife
was a most wonderful woman. She built her
closets, and then she filled them, and then she
remembered all about them and their contents.
Here is the plan of the first floor. A hall through
the middle. On the left as you enter is the
library. There was one closet connected with this
room, and a door opened into it from the northeast
corner. Back of the library was the dining-room.
It had three closets connected with it;
doors leading to them from three corners of the
room. To the left of the dining-room you passed
into a side entry. Three doors opened into three
large closets. The kitchen adjoined the dining-room.
There was one closet in it, and two closets
out of it to the right, and these two latter had one
closet and two closets respectively.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">
<img src="images/p024.png" width="590" height="434" alt="parlor" />
</div>

<p>On the right of the hall was the parlor. It had
one closet. A large window reaching to the floor
gave entrance to this room near the northeast
corner. Back of the parlor was a long, dark
closet which made a passage-way from the hall
to the schoolroom. Back of this closet was a
first-floor chamber with three closets. The third
of these closets opened into the chamber from the
north. It was formerly Mrs. "Judge's" store-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Another large closet was connected with
it, and these two large closets contained two small
closets. To the east of this chamber was the
schoolroom (formerly the Judge's library). This
room had two closets in it, and two closets out of
it. The room to the north of the schoolroom
was the annex to the Judge's library, and it held
his books bequeathed to the minister. It also
held two closets. And now my first story is
ended.</p>

<p>The short hall on the second floor opens at the
rear into a long, narrow hall. There are five
chambers in this part of the house. The front
room on the right as you look toward the street
is the "Study," and it has two closets, one on
each side of the big chimney. The two chambers
back and to the left as you face the chimney are
without a single closet; but the lack is made up
when you pass to the other side of the house.
The front chamber has two closets, one on each
side of the chimney. As you pass into the one
on the right (you face the chimney, remember) a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
door opens to the right and leads you into another
large closet with a window in it. Going across
this closet to the right another door opens into
a big, dark closet; turning to the street and
stepping back three paces you open a door into
another closet; passing into this one (there is
a small window in it) you open a door into the
linen closet. Withdrawing from this series of
small rooms, you get into the Betsey-Bartram
room, and there you find on the south side two
doors leading into two large closets. North of
this room is another bedroom. One closet lies in
the southeast corner, and one opens to you from
the west side of the room. The thirteenth closet
on this floor is at the end of the back hall, and the
fourteenth is by the side of the chimney in the
room above the down-stairs chamber. The attic
was one big room with five closets scattered
around the chimneys. They hung hams in the
larger one. It was a fine place to smoke meat.
There was always a greasy, smothered flavor to
the air in that place.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, if you have kept track of the closets you
will see that we number only fifty-one. There
had been three neat, retired little closets under
the stairs in the first-floor hall. When the hall
was enlarged these poor things were taken out.
It was on this occasion that Samuel said: "See
how rich we are; for we have closets to burn."
And still there are six closets missing. Well, the
closet with the skeleton in it is a mystery, and I
do not like to speak of it. Three closets were
found one day carefully tucked away in a corner
of the attic. The other two missing ones have
simply grown up and become big rooms with windows
in them. They put on a good deal of style,
and look down upon the other closets.</p>

<p>What a lovely time the Judge's wife had in furnishing
her new home. I have been reading the
bills, yellow-stained and time-worn. She had a
taste for handsome things. As the house was a
colonial building, the grandest in that part of the
country, she tried to get furniture that matched.</p>

<p>There were mahogany chairs and tables, sofas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and bedsteads, cabinets and stands. She paid $155
in gold for her gilt-framed looking-glass, which
stood between the front windows in the parlor,
and $125 for her Grecian sofa with cushions.
There were twelve fancy-chairs and two arm-chairs.
Her rocker cost $25. Then she had
another little work-table, for which they paid
$20.75.</p>

<p>Her parlor carpet was made in England. The
Judge had it made to order; so you may believe
it was uncommonly fine. The curtains were yellow
damask, lined with chintz. During the summer
these curtains were stored away on long
shelves in one of the closets, and lace curtains
hung in their places.</p>

<p>Every large room in the house had a fireplace,
and the supply of andirons was enormous. Some
of them cost $19 and $20. Then there were
venetian blinds in the parlor; and on the centre
table stood an astral bronzed lamp worth $18,
and on the mantle, high silver candlesticks. A
plated pair cost them $18, and the snuffers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
tray $8 more. There were the best Brussels
carpets, the most fashionable china and silver,
the richest linen for the table,&mdash;a vast amount
of things needed to make a house pleasant and
comfortable.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop1-i.jpg" width="153" height="185" alt="I"/>
</div>
<div class='drop-cap'>IT was on this wise that the present
family came to live in the parsonage.
The church had been without
a pastor for several months, and
the people were tired of hearing
Tom, Dick, and Harry in the pulpit. But
what was to be done? They had found no
man that suited them. One minister was too
young, and another too old. The first candidate
had a very long neck, a sort of crane neck, and it
made some of the ladies nervous. The last candidate
was fat, and everybody said he must be
lazy. Several were so anxious to come that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
congregation turned against them. There was
always some reason why each man was not liked.
So it began to look as if they might never get
another minister.</div>

<p>The society finally asked the ladies their views
upon the subject. It was one afternoon when the
Dorcas Daughters were sewing for the poor. The
president of the little band had been reading
a missionary letter. "Well," she said, "I have
heard so much about filling the pulpit that I
am sick of it. I think it's about time that we
filled the parsonage. Just see what kind of ministers
we have had for the last thirty years.
Two bachelors, and one married man without a
chick or a child. I say that it's time for us to
call a man to fill the parsonage."</p>

<p>"Why, that's what I think!" remarked one
of the mothers present. "It is a shame to have
that great house given over to the rats and
mice. And I know that not a minister has been
in it for all these years that used more'n half
or two-thirds of the room. But, dear me, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
would take a pretty big family to fill the parsonage!
Let me see; there are twenty-seven
rooms and sixty closets, aren't there?"</p>

<p>"So they say," replied the president. "I never
counted them. But that would just suit some
folks."</p>

<p>"Where is that letter that you read us at the
last meeting?" inquired one of the sisters. "How
many children did that man say he had? I remember
that we never sent another box like it
to a home missionary in all the history of this
church." "I've got the letter right here in my
hand," said the president, "and I've had that
man in mind for a week. He's got fifteen
children,&mdash;eight of his own, and seven of his
deceased sister. I shouldn't wonder if he was
the very one we want." One of the younger
women nodded. She was thinking of playmates
for her boys and girls. "And then if they overflowed
the house," continued the president, "there
is the little building in the yard. They might
start a cottage system. You know that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
way they do in schools these days. Divide up
the young folks, and set them in small companies.
The minister might do it; and if the
family expanded we might build two or three
extra cottages."</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. President," said one of the ladies,
"I fear you are making fun. But I think that
letter from the missionary with fifteen children in
the family was the best we ever had. A man
that could write such a letter must be very much
of a man."</p>

<p>"He is," replied the president. "I have looked
him up in the Year Book, and I have written to
the secretary of the Missionary Society. He's a
very good man. Nobody has done better work
in that frontier country."</p>

<p>So the ladies said that they would ask the
church to call this parson with the big family.
When the meeting was held and everybody was
talking, one gentleman arose, and told the people
that the ladies had a candidate. His name being
proposed, the president of the Dorcas Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
explained how she felt, that they ought to have
a man to fill the parsonage, and this man whom
they named was the one to do it; therefore the
meeting voted unanimously to call him.</p>

<p>"I think we had better charter a train to bring
them from the West," said one of the deacons.
But it was finally decided to engage a car; so
everything was arranged, and in four weeks they
came.</p>

<p>When the train stopped at the station, the
church committee was on hand with three carryalls.
It reminded one of an orphanage, or a
company of Fresh-air children. But a hearty
welcome was given; they were hurried into the
carriages, and soon the whole family was in the
parsonage.</p>

<p>A nice dinner had been prepared by the ladies
of the parish. After the travellers had washed
and made some slight changes, they all sat down
to the feast.</p>

<p>It was a happy thing that the church and the
Judge furnished the parsonage. This poor, large-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
missionary brought nothing with him but
books and children; his library was really a very
fine one, and it had filled the small house in the
West. His own family of children had been increased
by the seven orphans left when his sister
and her husband died. There was nothing for him
to do but adopt them; so they had been packed
into the little home until one was reminded of
a box of sardines. But this sort of kindness
was like the good man. He was ready to share
the last crust with any one who needed it.</p>

<p>"Why, what a big house it is!" exclaimed
Grace. "Just see; I guess we could put the
whole of our Western house right here in the
parlor." And I think they could if they had
only brought it along with them. When dinner
was over the children scattered all through the
mansion and the grounds.</p>

<p>What a delightful sense of freedom and importance
they had. Could it be possible that all
these things belonged to them? Were the ten
acres of lawn, garden, orchard, field, and pasture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
really for their use and pleasure? As parents
and children wandered through the big rooms,
and peered into the sixty closets, and looked out
of the numerous windows, it seemed to them like
a dream. And yet the dreamy sensation soon
passed; for the parson and his wife, happening to
look out of a front window, were struck with
the expression of alarm, amusement, or interest
shown by several people going along the street.
It was caused by the way in which the family
was showing its presence and possession. There
were three children on the front piazza standing
in a row gazing at the sea; four of the younger
ones were climbing in and out of the windows
on the second floor, running along the tin roof
of the piazza; two boys had already climbed a
tree looking for birds' nests; three children had
hurried through the attic to the roof, and leaned
against the big chimneys that towered over the
house. With curious interest they were taking
a general survey of the town and country, quite
unconscious that their rashness attracted any attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
The other youngsters were having a
frolic in the yard, walking along the top of the
picket-fence, jumping from one gate-post to another,
shouting with healthful lungs, and making
the very welkin ring.</p>

<p>Had a pack of wild Indians swooped down
upon the house, they could not have made themselves
more evident, or excited any greater concern
in town. It was clear that the minister
who was called to fill the parsonage answered
the purpose. He filled it; and the contents were
overflowing from doors and windows on to piazzas
and roofs, or into yard and trees and street.
What a waking up for the rats and mice it was!
The mere racket and clatter were enough to drive
them out of their holes. But what a shaking
up for the old town!</p>

<p>The house stood on the main street. It was
an object of historic veneration. Everybody knew
all about it, and had a sort of watch-care over
it. Anything that went on in that house belonged
to the whole neighborhood. So that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was not long before all the people were talking
about the new arrivals. Men, women, and children
felt an impulse to walk or ride by the
parsonage on that eventful day. And it was
a startling sight; for the minister's
family seemed to think that
the house really belonged to them,
and they were to enjoy
it just the way
they pleased. This
running all through
the many rooms, and
popping out of the
many windows upon
the piazza, and climbing
up to the roof,
and playing tag in the
yard, and hunting for birds' nests, and walking
on the tops of the pickets along the fence, was
their way of enjoying the place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/p041.png" width="325" height="454" alt="boy hanging flag on chimney" />
</div>

<p>"Let's nail the flag to the chimney," shouted
Harry, the third boy. They had carried the flag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in hand all through their journey from the West.
"Yes," shouted the other boys, who were wildly
patriotic. "Come on! come on!" So they all
came on except the youngest; and she finally
came in the arms of her father, who followed the
mother, who followed the children, to see what
was doing in the attic or on the roof. And just
at this time the most important man in the church
and town drove by with his family. Do you
wonder that this important man and his family
gazed with surprise and alarm at the sight?
There on the roof of the house was the whole
family. Henry was nailing the flag to the tallest
chimney. But when the children saw this
kind man pass along the street (he was one of
the committee that met them at the station, and
it was his horses that had carried them to the
parsonage), they waved their hands, and shook
their handkerchiefs, and shouted "Hurrah! hurrah!"
with such spirit that the gentleman must
needs take off his hat, smile and bow, and turn
to his family with some pleasing remark. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was no doubt in his mind or in the mind of the
passer-by that the town was captured. The West
had made a sudden onset; and the standard of
victory now floated from the chimney of the
Judge's mansion. The only thing for the natives
to do was to submit and make the best of the
situation.</p>

<p>As I said, the good people of the parish furnished
the parsonage. The carpets were down, and
the chairs, tables, sofas, bedsteads, stands, book-cases,
and other things, were put in their places.
All the minister's wife had to do was to unpack
her trunks, and divide up their contents among
the closets. All the minister had to do was to
unpack his boxes, and arrange his books in the
study. So they were settled in a trice.</p>

<p>Here is the picture of the children. You must
know them in order to understand what happened
in the house. Elizabeth was the oldest. She
must have been seventeen or eighteen. She was
ready for college. It was hard for the mother to
get along without her, since she had brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
all the younger ones, and given her mother a
chance to go round with her father in his work.
Elizabeth was very mature, but she had all the
frankness and cordiality of a typical Westerner.
She seemed almost too free and easy in her manners
for the slow East. But you couldn't help
liking her. A little Western gush does good in
the town.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 588px;">
<img src="images/p044.png" width="588" height="257" alt="many chidlren and a pony cart" />
</div>

<p>Samuel came next. He knew everything. He
was ready for college too. He was slow, and not
always just as agreeable as one would like to have
him. It has been said that somebody stepped on
his toes when he was a very little child, and that
he still has spells of being angry about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Samuel was a mechanic. He kept things in
order,&mdash;machines, carts, clocks, and like objects,&mdash;when
he hadn't any girls to tease; for he was
an awful tease, and so was liked in a general
way by all of them. His manner toward the
younger members of the family was rather severe
and overbearing. But what would you expect
from a big boy who knows so much, and has
such a host of children to live with?</p>

<p>Helen was the third one. She was literary,
and gave a great deal of time to books. She
hated to darn stockings above all things, and
would often read a story to the children, or
write one for them, if she could get somebody
to do her darning for her. I think she will
make an author. The family hadn't been in the
house one day before she said that the closets
must be named. Her mother or the children would
never be able to keep track of them, unless they
were reduced to a system, and properly numbered
like rooms in a hotel, or labelled like drugs
in a store.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry and Miriam were twins. They were
just about as unlike as you could make them,&mdash;one
light and the other dark; the first lean
and the second fat; he quick and she slow.
And so we might go through a long list of
things, and find that one was opposite to the
other. For this reason they got along well together
and were very happy.</p>

<p>Then came cousin George, who was fond of
music and could sing like a lark; and Theodora,
who was born to be a lady, and always took
the part of Mrs. Rothschild or Mrs. Astor in their
plays; and cousin Herbert, who will be a doctor,
and who was so ingenious about getting into
mischief that I think he will be able to invent
enough bad doses to cure the very worst sicknesses;
and cousin Ethel, the pink of propriety,
who never got a spot on her dress, and always
said, "Will you please give me this or that?"
or "Thank you," when she took anything; and
cousin Grace, the demure and quiet puss who
had a wonderful faculty for stirring up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
whole family, and yet freeing herself from trouble;
and cousin Susie, who is always sweet and good-tempered,
and loves everybody; and cousin William,
the precocious (I mean very smart), who will
be president of the United States; and cousin
Nathaniel, who was said by his brothers and
sisters and cousins to be "just too cute for anything,"
flying hither and thither like a humming-bird,
never two minutes in one place except when
his aunt got him into his nest at night. How
many does that make? Let me count them up.
Have I mentioned them all but Ruth? Ruth was
seven years old. She could ask more questions
in five minutes than any lawyer in cross-examining
witnesses. And when she was tired of
asking questions she would tease for more things
in a second five minutes than any twenty children
rolled into one. And not only would she ask
the same question seventeen times at once, or
tease for the same thing thirteen times without
stopping, but she did it in just the same unvarying,
shrill tone of voice; so that it was like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the monotonous rasping of a saw, and had a
tendency to drive a sensitive person out of his
head. How many times did the older members
of the family run from her as though she had
a contagious disease, so that they might get relief
from that endless asking and teasing? And
yet she had many good traits, and was certainly
very bright. If there had been some comfortable
way of putting a muzzle upon talkative
and tedious children, her parents would probably
have done it; but they simply used all the powers
of restraint that they had and let it go at
that. Ruth was evidently cut out for a poet or
a woman's rights speaker; for she was all the
time getting up rhymes, or talking in a high
key and impulsive way to such members of the
family as would listen to her.</p>

<p>When the baby came everybody said that he
must be called "The Little Judge," in honor of
the good man who gave the house to the church
for the minister.</p>

<p>No sooner was the family really settled than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the children began to ask about this famous
Judge. They had never lived in an old, historic
house before, and they were interested. They
knew how the Judge and his wife looked, for
their portraits hung in the east parlor. What fine
old people they must have been! If those oil
paintings did them justice they were about as
nice-looking as anybody that you see preserved
in oil in the great galleries of the world.</p>

<p>Whenever the children stood before the pictures,
they asked questions: Who was the Judge? what
did he do? how much of a family did he have?
did he like children? when did he die? who attended
the funeral? where was he buried? what
became of his things? and a hundred other questions.
So the minister began to read about the
Judge and his work. And the more he read, the
more he admired and loved. The enthusiasm
which the minister showed in his attempts to learn
all he could about the generous giver of the parsonage
excited the curiosity of the children to
such an extent that they begged their father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
uncle to write a book about him. Helen herself
talked about doing something of the kind.</p>

<p>"I've found out more things in the life of the
Judge," the minister would say; and then all
the children gathered around him just after supper,
as the fire burned gayly on the hearth in his
study, and he would tell them some fresh incident,
and add a few lines to his pen portrait of the
man. So the months chased each other; and the
Judge and his wife made not only the most common
topic of conversation, but they became as
real to the young people in the parsonage as the
boys and girls they met on the street. I suppose
it was because they thought and talked so much
about them that the strange things which I am
to relate happened (or didn't happen) in the house.</p>

<p>They had not lived many weeks in the house
before they got into all sorts of trouble about the
closets. They kept losing something, or losing
themselves, or losing the closets.</p>

<p>"We'll number them," suggested Herbert.</p>

<p>"No; let's name them," cried William. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
had all met to talk the matter over; so it was
decided to do both. When names run out they
would fall back on numbers.</p>

<p>"I feel like Adam when he named all the
cattle and the fowls and the beasts," exclaimed
Helen.</p>

<p>"We'll hang a plan of the house on each floor,
and then we can refer to it without running up-and
down-stairs." This was Samuel's remark.
He was always for saving steps. So names were
suggested, plans were drawn, every closet was
given its dues, and the atmosphere was thick with
Champagne, Darkest Africa, Turpentine, Leghorn,
Daisy, Pansy, Violet, Rose, Panama, China, Greece,
Dublin, Clementine, Serpentine, Argentine, Morocco,
and other appropriate names.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a><br /><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop2-i.jpg" width="97" height="209" alt="I"/>
</div>
<div class='drop-cap'>IT was Christmas Eve. Excitement had
reached fever heat. The children knew
nothing about Christmas in the East;
and their Western festivals had always
been simple, for there was little money
to use in buying gifts. But this year friends
had remembered them, and they had also earned
several dollars by various kinds of work; so that
they were sure of many nice things. Had they
not been buying presents for each other these ten
days? and was not every closet in the house
made the hiding-place for some treasure?</div>

<p>The nervous strain on the parents was great.
Such confusion and anxiety passed words. Was
it possible ever to get the house and the family
settled down to plain, every-day living again?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>It happened that the children had all met in
the east parlor. This was the room where the
pictures of the Judge and his wife adorned the
wall. The two portraits hung on the right of
the fireplace, you remember, just over the piano.
A lamp was giving a faint light on the marble
centre-table, and a cheerful wood fire was burning
on the hearth. In front of the piano was the
music stool.</p>

<p>The children were all talking. The hum and
buzz of their many voices filled the room. One
said, "I wonder if Santa Claus will bring me a
doll;" and another said, "There is no such person
as Santa Claus;" and a third said, "I
want a new sled;" and a fourth said, "Father
promised me a book about birds;" and so the talk
continued.</p>

<p>But Ruth for once kept still. She was worn
out with excitement. As she flung herself into
a big arm-chair, she turned her head towards the
fire, and began to see all sorts of funny creatures
dancing in and out among the coals. Ruth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
was a poet, you remember, gifted with a wonderful
imagination; and she could see more strange
things, and tell more wild stories, than any other
child in the family; and that is saying a great
deal, for they all had a way of telling about
things which they had heard and seen that constantly
reminded their neighbors of Western largeness
and exaggeration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/p059.png" width="580" height="525" alt="Girl sitting in front of fire" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>As Ruth watched the queer creatures playing in
the fire her eyes grew heavy; and then she turned
her head away for a moment, and her eyes became
fixed upon the pictures of the Judge and his wife.
Did her head droop to one side, and did it fall
softly upon the cushion against the arm, or did
her eyes suddenly open wide with surprise, and
did she gaze with startled look upon a strange
scene before her?</p>

<p>For both the Judge and his wife seemed to be
moving; and they looked so natural and pleasant
when they smiled and bowed, that Ruth said to
herself, "Why, they must be alive." And the
Judge reached out his hand from the canvas
which held him, and took the hand of his wife,
who had responded to his motion, and said, "My
dear, wouldn't you like to step down and out for
a little while?"</p>


<p>"Yes, thank you," she replied; "I think it would
rest me." And then he laid down the pen, which
he holds in the picture, and stepped lightly upon
the piano, still keeping her hand in his; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he helped her down upon the piano, and then he
stepped down to the music stool, and finally on
the floor, and she followed. This was all done
with the grace and dignity that marked the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
movements both of the Judge and his wife. And
it seemed the most natural thing in the world for
them to step down and out.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 538px;">
<img src="images/p061.png" width="538" height="600" alt="Man climbing down off table out of portrait" />
</div>

<p>Ruth sprang toward them on the instant that
they stood upon the floor. She rubbed her eyes to
make sure that she was not dreaming; and then as
she saw them really before her, looking for all the
world like natural folks, she greeted them with
delight.</p>

<p>"Why, how do you do?" she exclaimed. "I
always thought you looked as if you would like to
talk. That, I suppose, is why people say that your
pictures are a 'speaking likeness.' But I never
thought you'd get out of the pictures. How did
you do it?" But the Judge and his wife were
too much absorbed in the scene before them to
reply immediately. The old room had changed
since their day; they were noting the changes.
And then this roomful of children took them by
surprise.</p>

<p>"My dear," said the Judge to his wife, "this is
delightful." "Yes," continued Ruth, "they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
belong to us. I heard the president of the Dorcas
Society say that when the church called this minister
they expected him to fill the parsonage just
as much as the pulpit. And we did it."</p>

<p>"Yes, this is delightful," repeated the Judge.
"How many are there?" He said this to his
wife, but Ruth answered.</p>

<p>"Oh! there are only fifteen of us when we are
by ourselves. There are a good many more when
the neighbors' children come in; and then don't we
have grand times!"</p>

<p>"It almost takes my breath away." Mrs.
"Judge" was speaking to her husband. "My dear,
have you my fan in your pocket?" And the Judge
felt in his pocket, but he didn't find any fan.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Christmas! You don't want a fan,"
said Ruth, who was bound to take part in the conversation,
and play the hostess on this wonderful
occasion. And then the Judge and his wife stood
stock-still, and gazed with increasing pleasure and
interest upon the scene.</p>

<p>Their descent from the picture had been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
noiseless and unexpected that Ruth was the only
one to observe it. But when this keen, talkative
sister began to question the guests, the other children
turned their heads, and they beheld the curious
sight. There stood the Judge and his wife
exactly as they appeared in the portraits. Only
they had their legs on them, and the pictures
didn't. But the children noticed even the smallest
details of dress, and they were the very originals
of the portraits.</p>

<p>Suddenly the whole company stood up.</p>

<p>"Why, it's just like a reception or a wedding,"
said Ruth. "I think they're all waiting to be
introduced." And the children advanced one
after another, or Ruth led the Judge and his wife
to different parts of the room, and each brother
and sister and cousin was properly presented.</p>

<p>"How did you get out?" inquired Ruth a second
time. Everybody in the room was now standing,
and all eyes were looking for the next move in
this strange parlor drama.</p>

<p>"We just stepped out," replied the Judge, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
seemed prepared at length to talk with Ruth or
the other children.</p>

<p>"But where did you keep your legs all the
time?" When Ethel asked this question Mrs.
"Judge" blushed. Elizabeth, the eldest daughter,
pushed her way forward, and said, "S-s-s-s-h!" and
Samuel said, with a nudge of the arm, "Keep still,
can't you?" But you might as well tell the
steaming teakettle to stop boiling as it sits upon
a lively fire.</p>

<p>"We are very glad to see you," interrupted
Helen. She was a most hospitable girl, and she
had read a great deal of history; although Henry
knew more history than she did, and he had read
everything about the Judge that he could lay his
hands on.</p>

<p>"We are very glad to see you, and should like to
ask about the 'Hartford Convention,'" said Henry.</p>

<p>"He's been talking about it for a month," continued
Ruth. "I wish you'd tell him all about it,
and then maybe he'd keep still. I don't care anything
about it, neither do the other children. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Henry thinks he's very smart in such things ever
since he got a prize in history."</p>

<p>"Did you say these were all the children?" It
was Mrs. "Judge" that now spoke. And as she
made the inquiry Susie ran out of the parlor,
and disappeared in the gloom of the hall.</p>

<p>"Why, we forgot all about the baby!" exclaimed
Ruth. "He's up-stairs asleep, I guess. Dear me,
you must see the baby. He's the cutest little
thing you ever saw."</p>

<p>"Yes, we should like to see him, of course. We
both like babies, good babies."</p>


<p>"Babies that don't cry I suppose you mean,"
said Ruth. "Well, he doesn't cry much,&mdash;only
when he's hungry, or a pin sticks into him, or he
gets mad, or somebody lets him fall, or hits his
head against the door or a chair." Here Ruth
paused for breath. Then she exclaimed, "Why,
of course, you must see the baby! Why, he is
named for you!" This was said to the Judge
with greatest excitement. And just as Ruth was
saying it everybody turned toward the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and there stood little Susie hugging the baby
to her breast, his nightdress dragging on the
floor, her short arms barely reaching around his
plump body; both baby and Susie having their
faces wreathed in smiles. Staggering under the
burden this
youngest sister
pressed
through the
company with
her precious
armful; and as
the Judge saw
her approach
he stepped forward,
bent
down above her, and took the little fellow into his
arms, where he settled with a most contented and
happy expression. It was a very pretty sight,&mdash;this
stately old gentleman holding a beautiful
baby on one arm, and reaching over to the lovely,
dignified wife by his side with the other arm;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for she had taken hold of his hand again after he
had fixed the baby comfortably on his arm, and
Ruth had stationed herself close by the Judge's
wife on the other side, and taken possession of
the lady's free hand.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/p067.png" width="383" height="387" alt="Girl carryinig baby" />
</div>

<p>"And this is the baby, is it?" inquired Mrs.
"Judge." "What a dear little boy he is! And
what did you say you called him?" For the lady
was either deaf or absorbed so that she did not
hear all that Ruth had said about the baby's name.</p>

<p>"Why, we call him after your husband. Didn't
you hear me say so? He is the "Little Judge."
Just see how he clings to his namesake. Is he
the Judge's namesake or the Judge his namesake?
I don't know which is which, only it's something
about namesake, and he's named for the Judge."
This latter talk on the part of Ruth was quite as
much to herself as to the visitors. And all the
time the Judge was gazing down into the infant's
face with earnest, wistful look, seeming almost to
forget that he was once more standing in the old
east parlor. Yes, for a moment he had really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
forgotten where he did stand; for he was thinking
of the many years ago when two other baby
boys had been placed in his arms, and with what
hope and tenderness he had handled the small,
helpless pieces of humanity.</p>

<p>"Don't you like the name?" interrupted Ruth.
"We thought it would please you. What makes
you look so solemn? Oh, I know!" Now, Ruth
did not intend to be cruel. She was simply
thoughtless like many other children.</p>

<p>"You had a baby boy once, didn't you? Two
of 'em, didn't you?" And then she saw that Mrs.
"Judge" seemed to feel bad too, and that she let
go the Judge's hand for a moment, and dashed
away some tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if I've hurt your feelings," said
Ruth. "I didn't mean to. I was just thinking
about your two baby boys. They would have
been awful old if they had lived till now, wouldn't
they? and we never should have lived in this
house if they had lived, would we?" A hush had
fallen on the company. Neither the Judge nor his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
wife made any reply. They were lost in thought,
while the children watched them with breathless
interest.</p>

<p>"We didn't dare give him your full name,"
continued Ruth. "That's what Dr. Blank did to
one of his baby boys, and it died. Mother was
afraid if we called our baby after you, with the
three long names, that it might kill him, so she
said; so we dropped the middle one, and I think
it much better, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Dear little boy," said the Judge affectionately,
as he looked down into his face again. "Dear
little boy." And then the Judge bent down and
kissed him, and the baby beamed with delight.
It was almost like a baptism in church.</p>

<p>"I thought maybe you were going to pray over
him. That's the way father does, you know."
But the Judge didn't seem to hear.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, turning to his wife and
holding the baby toward her. She knew what
he meant, for she likewise bent down over the
little fellow and printed another kiss upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sweet, upturned, dimpled face, and then another,
and a third, while the Judge stood looking on
with happy indulgence; and all the children noted
every motion in this singular drama.</p>

<p>"What did your boys die of?" asked Ruth,
who did not wish to lose any time, since she had
so many questions to ask, and she feared that
her visitors might not stay as long as she wished
them.</p>

<p>"Ruth!" exclaimed Samuel, who had drawn
near the young inquisitor, and felt it was time
to stop her; "aren't you ashamed of yourself?"
He said this in a low tone, thinking that the Judge
and his wife might not hear. They were watching
the baby with such eagerness that they had
almost forgotten the rest of the company.</p>

<p>"I think," remarked Mrs. "Judge," as she lifted
her head from the baby and glanced around the
room, "that it is very pleasant in the old house."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; we think so too." It was Ruth again
speaking. The other members of the family had
little chance to say anything. "Can't get in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a word edgewise," whispered Henry to Helen.
"What a perfect nuisance Ruth is!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to go over the house?"
Of course it was Ruth who asked the question.
She was always taking people over the house. It
might be Monday morning when everything was
in dire confusion, and all the younger children still
in bed, or it might be early evening after the baby
and Susie had been playing in crib and bed, and
things were assuming their wonted appearance of
disorder. If the notion took her she was always
ready to seize a caller by the hand, and lead him
from cellar to garret.</p>

<p>"I think I would like to look around a little,"
replied the lady. "I am wondering how many
closets you have now in the house."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is an awful lot!" exclaimed Ruth.</p>

<p>"We have sixty," observed Elizabeth, who liked
to be precise.</p>

<p>"That's right, that's right," continued Mrs.
"Judge." "I had that number put in. I was
afraid you might have given away some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
them." When she said this the children looked
rather queer. Who ever heard of giving away
closets? One might think they were flowers, or
eggs, or peaches.</p>

<p>"You used to give away a great deal, didn't
you?" exclaimed Ruth. "But I don't see how
you could give away closets."</p>

<p>And now the whole company started on a tour
of sight-seeing in the old house. Samuel and
Elizabeth naturally took the lead, being the oldest
and quite the lady and gentleman. The Judge
with the baby on one arm and his wife leaning
on the other followed. Ruth still clung to the
right hand of Mrs. "Judge." Then the remaining
children came in a dense crowd just behind them.</p>

<p>"The parlor looks much as it did when we left
it, except the furniture," said the lady. "Now
let us see if they have kept the other rooms as
well."</p>

<p>They passed next into the hall.</p>

<p>"Dear me! what is this?" exclaimed the Judge.
"Where are we?" For it was not the old hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
at all. That had been rather short and small.
This was long, reaching through the house.</p>

<p>"Why, what has become of my bedroom?"
inquired the lady. "They have made it into this
hall. And where are all the nice little closets
under the stairs? You certainly have given them
away. Oh, dear! oh, dear! I'm so sorry."</p>

<p>"I guess you're tired," said Ruth. "It makes
you nervous to walk much, doesn't it? Why, yes,
I know, because they say you never went up-stairs
for ever so many years. Oh, I know what we'll
do! You can ride." All this time Mrs. "Judge"
was looking about her in a dazed way, quite at
sea in respect to her surroundings. For the hall
had been completely changed until it appeared
about as different as different could be. And the
good lady was really shocked.</p>

<p>"Do you see those things under the stairs?
They are our bicycles."</p>

<p>And the Judge and his wife gazed with perplexed
faces in the direction indicated. There
was a whole row of them. Seven, altogether,&mdash;full-grown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
half-grown, or any size you might
wish. It was like a carriage shop.</p>

<p>"I think you might ride one all through the
house down-stairs," said Ruth to the lady guest.
"Then you wouldn't have to walk."</p>

<p>And as the suggestion was made, Ruth's eyes
flashed, and her cheeks grew flushed with excitement.
What fun it would be to push the good
woman on a bicycle from room to room, and show
her the present arrangements of the beloved house.
But Mrs. "Judge" was horrified. She clung very
closely to her husband, as if she thought that she
might have to perch upon one of the machines
whether she wished it or not. Her breath came
fast and short. Her cheeks grew hectic.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that people ride those
things!" she finally exclaimed when her first flurry
of agitation was past.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ruth delightedly; "we all ride
'em."</p>

<p>"Not your father and mother,&mdash;the minister
and the minister's wife?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, yes, and the Episcopal minister too,
and his wife."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Judge, that you didn't bring a
fan with you?" The good woman seemed very
faint, and she looked beseechingly toward her
husband. "Here's one," shouted Susie, who ran
to the cabinet and found a lovely piece of feather
work, which scattered very fine feathers over your
clothes and through the room on every motion
you made with it. And as the Judge's wife
waved it back and forth the feathers began to
fly.</p>

<p>"It looks like a snow-storm," whispered Herbert
to Theodora. And soon the feather flakes
adorned their garments and floated through the
air, so that one was really reminded of a fresh
fall of snow.</p>

<p>It took the good lady a long time to get her
breath. The hall closets were all gone; and in
their places stood seven things called bicycles,
upon which the minister, his wife, and the children
were said to ride. It was awful. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Ruth was urging her to try one. Alas! the hall
was too much for her self-possession.</p>

<p>"Let us go into the west room," she said
faintly. So they all came into what is now the
family sitting-room and library. Here everything
was strange. The door into the kitchen was covered
with a high book-case filled with literature.
The small cubby-hole through which dishes and
food had been passed from dining-room to kitchen
was now made into a door. But there was one
familiar object before them. In the far corner
stood the clock, grave and stalwart sentinel for
the house.</p>

<p>"My dear, do you see the clock?" It was
the Judge speaking to his wife. He knew there
must be many changes in the house. He accepted
them very quietly; but he was glad to
see this old familiar friend. He had expected
to find it in the hall where it had always stood
during his day; but he was just as glad to see
it here in the old dining-room. That clock had
been present on all the great occasions of life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
It had marked the hours for every event connected
with the history of the house. When
the long line of famous men and women entertained
by the Judge and his wife came to mind,
it was to be recollected that the clock had seen
them all, and winked and blinked at them morning,
noon, and night, and sounded his warning
notes in their ears, when it was time to rise or
retire, or to eat, or to go to court, or to drive to
town, or to start for church. It was like meeting
a tried and beloved friend. Both the Judge
and his wife were overjoyed.</p>

<p>It might have been that some indifferent family
had lived in the house, and thrown the clock out
of doors or stored it in the attic. There are
people so dull and unimaginative, people with so
little sentiment, that they never care for keepsakes
or heirlooms. They want everything fresh
and new about them. Antiques are a perfect bore
or nuisance. Happily the minister's family was
not one of this kind. They all had a great deal
of what is called historic sense. They liked old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
things; and the clock was their most sacred possession.
How much they had talked about it,
and dreamed about the scenes which had passed
before it! While Ruth had invented more wild
stories in connection with that one object than
could be told in many a day.</p>

<p>The other things in the room attracted little attention.
The visitors made their slow and stately
way across to the corner where the clock stood.
As they looked up into its serene face, the object
of their interest looked down upon them with
a very knowing expression, seeming to recognize
them on the instant, extending them a very hearty
welcome; for the tick, tick was louder than ever
before, the very frame of the huge thing began
to tremble with suppressed excitement, and then
eight long, loud strokes sounded through the entire
house, as much as to say, "They've come,"
"How'd do?" "Glad t'see you," and other kind
greetings. The children had all followed the Judge
and his wife, and they were eagerly watching for
the next movement on the part of the visitors.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">
<img src="images/p080.png" width="456" height="600" alt="children lookiing at clock" />
</div>

<p>It made quite a striking picture,&mdash;the
tall, solemn clock in
the far corner of the room, the
Judge and the baby on his arm,
and the wife holding Ruth by
the hand, standing in front
of it; then the throng of
alert and wondering children
bringing up in the rear, for they all felt
that something out of the ordinary was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
happen. In fact, the whole visit of these former
inhabitants of the house was rather unusual, so
that the children would naturally expect fresh
marvels at any moment. It was clear that Mrs.
"Judge" was getting tired; nobody had offered
her a chair, and she had refused to get on a
bicycle.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door of the clock swung open.</p>

<p>"I think you had better rest, my dear," said
the Judge; "we'll step in here."</p>

<p>And as he made the remark he put his foot
into the clock and gave a lively spring, filling the
small doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't take the baby away!"
screamed Ruth, as she saw them both disappearing.
"Who'll nurse him? And mamma'll feel
so bad."</p>

<p>But it was all done so quickly that Ruth
never finished her speech, for the Judge still
held his wife's hand and helped her into the
clock; then as Ruth held all the faster to
the lady's hand, she was caught up too, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
all went into the clock and the door shut upon
them.</p>

<p>The other children were struck dumb with
amazement.</p>

<p>"I always thought it looked like a coffin,"
exclaimed Samuel; "but I never expected to see
four people buried alive in it."</p>

<p>"I've wanted to hide in it a hundred times,"
said Helen, "but I never supposed"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ten thousand times are hid in it," interrupted
Henry.</p>

<p>"Times out of mind," whispered Herbert.</p>

<p>"Time, time," cried Samuel; and soon they
indeed had a "time."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop5-t.jpg" width="232" height="182" alt="T"/>
</div>
<div class='drop-cap'>THE first thing that the children
who were left behind did
was to examine the clock.
They all made a rush for it,
and pulled open the door.
"Tick, tock, tick, tock," went the huge machine.
They saw the pendulum swing back and forth.
And that was all they did see. The Judge, his
wife, Ruth, and the baby had disappeared.</div>

<p>"I believe this house is bewitched, or we are!"
exclaimed Helen. She had read about the strange
things said and done in the old town more than
two centuries ago, when witches rode through the
air on broomsticks, and very lively times stirred
up the people.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was on this very spot, I've heard father
say, that one of the witches lived."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" cried Samuel, who knew everything;
"there isn't any such thing as witchcraft.
They've just stepped out for a moment, and
they'll come back soon."</p>

<p>"I think they've stepped in," replied Henry,
who stood close to the clock when their visitors
disappeared with Ruth and the baby. "Let's
play 'tag' while we're waiting for them to come
back." This was a good way to work off their
nervousness; for they were all more or less nervous,
either because they really thought that the
witches might be upon them, or because they
would have to answer to their parents for the
absence of Ruth and the baby.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 577px;"><a id="Illus87"></a>
<img src="images/p087.png" width="577" height="526" alt="boy on top of bookczase with others watching" />
</div>

<p>"We'll start from the piano," said Samuel. It
was Christmas Eve, you remember, and everything
seemed rather uncommon and surprising.
So they all jumped upon the piano,&mdash;thirteen of
them altogether,&mdash;and it made the old instrument
shiver and rattle, and try to shake them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
off. Then they started on the game of "tag."
Samuel sprang from the piano to the cabinet,
from the cabinet to the mantle, and from the
mantle to the glass book-case in the corner; and
they all jumped after him and each other. Then
he swung himself over to the hall door, for his
arms and his legs were simply prodigious. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the top of the door he leaped to the big picture
frame between the front windows. How it swayed
and creaked and screamed! So he dropped down
upon a low book-case beneath, and balanced himself
on the edges of a crystal loving-cup. But
Henry and Herbert had started in the other direction
from the piano, and they came face to
face with Samuel on the loving-cup. Then this
elder brother sprang over to the marble centre-table,
and then across to the piano again, and
upon the high set of book-shelves in the southwest
corner of the room. Here he began to grab
the books, and throw them at the other children
as they came near him. Then they threw books
back at him. And what a commotion there was!
Children were passing and repassing with the
speed of the wind. They were leaping from
picture to picture, and mantle to table, and piano
to book-case, and table to chairs, and cabinet to
door; books were flying in every direction, the
piano was groaning and shaking and scolding,
and there was the din of many voices, shoutings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
laughter, cries, boys' clothes and girls'
clothes woven into a perfect mass of changing
colors and shapes, the bang and rattle of moving
furniture, and whatever you may be pleased to
imagine.</p>

<p>All this time the Judge, his wife, Ruth, and
the baby sat composedly behind the face of the
clock, and looked down delightedly upon the hilarious
scene. There was a hole in the clock's
face which served them for a window. Ruth had
often observed it; and she had told her mother
more than a few times that she was perfectly
sure there must be a big room up there, and
lots of people in it, for she had seen the flash of
their eyes when they peeped down into the room
and watched (wouldn't it be more proper to say
clocked) the people. Ruth, of course, was right;
for wasn't there a big room in the top of the
clock? and didn't the Judge and his wife know
all about it? It was there that they had gone
to rest.</p>

<p>The first thing they did was to put Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
"Judge" to bed. This they did with her shoes on.
The next thing was to get the baby to sleep. So
the Judge sat down in a rocking-chair, and began
to sing to his little namesake; and when he got
tired of singing the Judge whistled. The baby
was just as good as he could be. He laughed,
and cooed, and hit the old gentleman on the
cheek with a tiny hand, and tried to pick his
eyes out one by one, count all his teeth, and
pull off his eyebrows, dig into his ears, and find
what he did with his nose, and how he kept his
cravat on. Meanwhile Ruth was looking down
upon the children, and reporting their doings to
her visitors.</p>

<p>"I think it will do them good to have a little
frolic," said the Judge.</p>

<p>"Yes, let them play," replied Mrs. "Judge."
"It makes me feel as if we were once more back
in the old home, and had children to fill it and
bring us joy."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't let your children play like
that," said Ruth. "Why, I think they're going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to break every thing to pieces. And what will the
church committee say? They have charge of the
house, you know."</p>

<p>"Let's see what they are doing!" exclaimed
the Judge. So he put the baby down by his wife
while he looked through the eye of the clock.
Just at that moment the children had all jumped
upon the centre-table; and it was crowded with
thirteen of them, and the lamp in the middle.
There was a brief struggle, then the lamp went
out, and the noise of a great fall and crash
sounded through the room, after which darkness
and silence prevailed. Something had evidently
happened.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we might visit the closets
now?" inquired Ruth. The Judge turned to his
wife to see what she answered.</p>

<p>"I am too tired to go through them," she
said. "But I should like to have them come
to me." Now, this was quite an original idea;
but it pleased Ruth.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I think they would like to come."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Ruth was speaking with great animation. "We've
named them, you know; and I think if I should
call them by their names they'd all be glad to see
you. Can you sit here by this hole in the clock?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" replied Mrs. "Judge." "That would
be very nice. And the closets can all pass in front
of us, and I can have a little talk with them."
So Ruth looked down again into the room where
the children had been playing, and saw that it
was quite light and the children were all gone.
At once she called the closets.</p>

<p>"I've got a list of their names in my pocket,"
she explained to Mrs. "Judge." "We can't remember
as you can. Even as it is, mother's all
the time losing something in some of the closets,
and she tries so hard to think where she puts
things. She ought to carry a blank-book with
her, and set everything down." The Judge's wife
was rested now, so that she sat up and took her
place before the hole in the clock. The baby
was back again in the arms of his namesake.
Then Ruth shouted out the names of the closets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
"Champagne," she cried. This was the name of
the wine-closet. It was a big black hole in the
main cellar, just under the parlor. Very soon
there was a heavy tread in the west parlor where
the clock stood, and
in swung Champagne.
Although
such a great closet
he looked very
thin and dismal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/p093.png" width="330" height="534" alt="Closet with feet walking by grandfather clock" />
</div>

<p>"Good-evening,"
said the
Judge's wife.</p>

<p>"How do you
do?" replied Champagne;
and there
was a great deal
of pain in his
voice.</p>

<p>"You don't seem happy," said Mrs. "Judge."</p>

<p>"I'm thirsty;" and the closet's voice sounded
as if a fever had parched it. "Poor folks live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
here now. They haven't put a bottle of wine
into me in forty years. I'm drying up. I shall
cave in one of these days."</p>

<p>"That would be dreadful, wouldn't it?" exclaimed
Ruth. "Would the house go down if
the wine-cellar caved in?"</p>

<p>"Hope so," answered Champagne testily.
"Don't even keep wine for sick folk. Somebody
did put a couple of bottles of something
into me when the children had the measles, but
somebody else came and stole it out of me. I
thought I'd help bring the measles out, but they
didn't give me a chance."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" exclaimed Mrs. "Judge." "I'm
sorry for you. But these are days of total
abstinence, you know. You mustn't expect much
wine. Don't they keep butter in you?"</p>

<p>"No, they don't make any. And when they
get some in the house it goes as fast as it comes.
This family eats an awful sight of butter."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll see what I can do for you, Champagne."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can fill him up with water," whispered
Ruth. "For the cistern leaks now, and father
says the overflow all goes into the wine-cellar.
I'll call 'Greece' next." Champagne stepped
one side, and stood by the front door.</p>

<p>"Greece, Greece." The name was spoken with
shrill, positive tones; and Greece came hurrying
down-stairs. This closet was in the attic. They
smoked the hams in him, and they sometimes
put bacon and dried beef up there.</p>

<p>"How do you get along?" inquired Mrs.
"Judge," as the closet shambled into the west
room.</p>

<p>"How'd' do, ma'am?" There was a strong
smell of ham when Greece made his appearance.</p>

<p>"I've mostly given up smoking these days.
I'm a poor, ham-sick fellow. They are trying
to starve me to death. I haven't had anything
in me for months. They won't let me
say anything. They shut me up all the time."</p>

<p>"I think Greece smells bad, don't you?" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Ruth as she turned to her guest. And then Ruth
put her thumb and forefinger up to her nose
to keep out the bad odors that seemed to come
up from poor Greece. "I'm going to call
'China.'" So Greece stepped one side without
one kind word. "China, China, China." There
was a very loud rattling of dishes, jingling of
glasses, and much music, as the long closet between
the kitchen and the dining-room stepped briskly
before them.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," said the Judge's
wife by way of greeting. She was a lover of
fine ware, and the house had been filled with
it.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see you," replied China.
"I am living a wretched life."</p>

<p>"Dear me, don't talk like that!" exclaimed
the good lady, much annoyed at all this mourning
and fault-finding.</p>

<p>"I guess you'd talk worse than that if you
had been cut down, torn to pieces, burnt up,
and boxed as I have been. Don't you see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
there is hardly anything left of me? As likely
as not to-morrow they'll set to work and do
something else to me,&mdash;make me smaller yet,
or drive me out of the house. I can't tell
what a day will bring forth. And just look
at the dishes. Did you ever see such a lot of
nicked, broken, mismatched, cracked, blackened,
ugly old ware as they keep on my shelves?
It makes me sick. I wish you'd come back."
All this time China had been talking in a
most despondent tone, giving a fresh shake of
discontent to the curious assortment of ware
displayed on the shelves. It made the Judge's
wife nervous. She didn't like it. Neither did
Ruth. It was not what they expected. Such
talk was hardly in keeping with Christmas
Eve.</p>

<p>"China, you just go right out-doors and wait
in the cold," said Ruth. "I'm going to call 'Panama.'
That, you know, is the closet that connects
father's study right over this room with the bedroom
behind it. Come, Panama," she cried. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
was a great rustling of papers, and dust filled the
room as Panama entered.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" inquired Mrs. "Judge,"
who began to sneeze and feel very thirsty.</p>

<p>"Why, this is the closet where father keeps his
sermons. I think they must rustle and make so
much noise because they are dry."</p>

<p>"Good-evening," said the lady in the clock as
she bowed.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," replied Panama. "It's a long
time since we've seen you, Madam. Have you
come back to stay?" And one could detect anxiety
in the manner and speech.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! We are here just for the evening.
We thought it would be pleasant to step down
and out for a little while. We were in the portraits
on the east parlor wall, you remember.
When the wind gets in the east we shall be
obliged to go back." Then Panama began to cry;
and as fast as he cried he drank up his tears.</p>

<p>"I don't see what's got into the closets to make
them talk so and act so!" exclaimed Ruth. "They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
just seem bent on being disagreeable to-night.
And I thought we'd have such a nice time with
them. They're a discontented and complaining
lot. I'm going to call 'Leghorn.'"</p>

<p>During this little talk the Judge's wife was
lost in thought. Her chin had dropped down
upon her breast, and a far-away look appeared
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Leghorn, Leghorn, come here!" shouted Ruth.</p>

<p>The children had given this name to the east-corner
closet in Mrs. "Judge's" bedroom. She
used to keep her bonnets there. One of them
was a white, beautiful Leghorn, which cost more
than twenty-five dollars. This closet was full of
shelves, and it proved very useful to the minister's
family.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," said the lady.</p>

<p>Leghorn looked up with surprise. He recognized
her voice.</p>

<p>"How do you do? When did you come?
What's the news?" Leghorn spoke in a very
familiar way; for he had always stayed close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the head of the bed in the room, and overheard
all the conversation between the Judge and his
wife. There was no better informed closet in
the house than Leghorn.</p>

<p>"You look quite cheerful," said the lady.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," he replied; "I keep very busy, and
have really more than I can 'tend to. You know,
we have a perfect crowd of girls here in the house,
and their hats just fill me up to the brim. Hear
'em fuss as I shake 'em." And as the folks in
the clock listened they heard such a racket of
straw and such a shrill chirping that they were
quite startled.</p>

<p>"Dear me, what is that queer noise?" inquired
Mrs. "Judge." "Have you a flock of birds inside
of you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I know what that is," explained Ruth.
"I can hear it above the rustling of the straw.
It's all the birds we have had on our hats. They
are feeling so good. For we have joined the
Audubon Society, and we can't wear any more
birds. How they flutter and sing, don't they?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't mean that you really wear whole
birds on a hat or a bonnet, do you?" One could
tell from the way she spoke that the visitor was
horrified.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; and you ought to see folks come
to church with them. I've counted seventeen
kinds of feathers and nine pieces of birds on the
girls and ladies while father was preaching his
sermon. We've had a bird-class here, you know,
and I can tell a great deal about 'em. There was
a blackbird and there was a bluebird; and one lady
had a hawk's wing, and another a rooster's tail,
and Elizabeth had the breast and beak of a scarlet
tanager, and Helen wore heron's feathers, and
mother had ostrich plumes; and you ought to
see the beautiful plumage we took from a wild
turkey sent us from the West; and we put it
on Susie's hat, and it was just too lovely for anything.
But we've all joined the Audubon Society
now, and can't kill any more birds or wear many
feathers."</p>

<p>"I'd like to join too," interrupted Leghorn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
"I'm sick of birds in me. They make such a
noise, and keep me stirred up all the time, so I
don't get good sleep. I'm very nervous, but I'm
quite happy."</p>

<p>"There, we've found one happy closet anyway,"
said Ruth. "You just sit down here and make
yourself comfortable."</p>

<p>"Darkest Africa next," shouted Ruth. This
was another of the closets connected with the
down-stairs bedroom. He came stumbling and
grumbling along.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he said in a grumpy,
disagreeable way. "You've kept me in the dark
so long, I've lost the use of my windows."</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't be so cross about it," answered
Ruth. "Don't you see it's Mrs. 'Judge'
that's come back to see you?"</p>

<p>"What? what?" cried Darkest Africa, rubbing
his eyes and speaking in his natural voice.
"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Why, up here in the clock, of course. Haven't
you any sense?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/p103.png" width="409" height="600" alt="line of closets walking in a crooked row" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, such a life as we're living!" he said,
turning toward the visitor.</p>

<p>"You remember how you used to keep all your
groceries in me, and how my shelves were heavy
with every good thing,&mdash;tea, coffee, spices, fruits,
and a thousand things. Well, now they've shut
the blinds, and covered the windows, and turned
me into a photograph-room. It's very nasty.
Bad smells hang all about me. Stove-pipe, pans
of dirty water, chemicals, and I don't know what,
make me very unhappy. And the children run
through your bedroom just as if it were a public
street. Such goings on you never did see. I want
to leave this world."</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed of you to talk that way, Darkest
Africa. You go out on the piazza, and wait
in the cold, too, until I call you. Such talk makes
Mrs. 'Judge' feel real bad." And this closet
withdrew, still mumbling about his troubles.</p>

<p>"I'm going to call three together now," said
Ruth; "for the baby'll wake up before we get
through, if I don't hurry." The Judge had really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
sung and whistled the baby to sleep; and there
the good man sat on the edge of a cog-wheel,
holding the little fellow in his arms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 162px;">
<img src="images/p105.png" width="162" height="303" alt="Judge sitting on gears holding small baby" />
</div>

<p>"Come, 'Pride,' 'Vanity,' and 'Ophir,'" screamed
Ruth. One of these closets held the clothes of
the older girls&mdash;that was Pride;
Vanity was filled with the many
dresses of the younger girls; and
Ophir was the closet where the
present family kept their small
stock of valuables, like jewelry,
silverware, and family heirlooms.
These three closets came
prancing down together, and
they certainly felt good. It was
Christmas Eve, and they knew it, for they were
running over with all sorts of packages; their
shelves were filled; their hooks were burdened
with garments; the very floors were piled high
with stuff. Mrs. "Judge" did not know them
so well by night, for she hadn't visited them for
many years before her going away. She bowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to them, and they bowed to her; but they kept
their hands in their pockets.</p>

<p>"Why don't you say something?" It was
Ruth's remark to them as they stood in a row
before the clock.</p>

<p>"We're waiting for you to say something
first," was the reply.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" This was by way of
starting the conversation.</p>

<p>"We feel jolly. Don't you?" Mrs. "Judge"
smiled. This was pleasant to hear, and she was
very cheerful. She could see thirty-seven or
fifty dresses. There were all sizes, colors, materials,
and patterns. Their brightness and variety
fascinated her.</p>

<p>"Look here, my dear," she said, turning to her
husband.</p>

<p>"I can't. I should wake the baby," and he
smiled in a very happy, dignified way.</p>

<p>"I'll call 'Morocco,' too," said Ruth. "There's
plenty of room, and I like to see them together."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Morocco, Morocco." And then there was
such clattering and pattering of shoes that it
seemed as if the baby must wake up; for Morocco
was the shoe closet, and there were so
many pairs of old shoes in the place that it reminded
one of a cobbler's shop. There were
little shoes and big, slippers and rubber-boots,
patent leathers and copper toes, high-heeled shoes
and no-heeled shoes; there were blacking and
brushes and shoe-strings and button-hooks and
dirt. And as Morocco walked in, every shoe
and boot and slipper and brush was in a most
frolicsome mood, jumping hither and thither,
knocking the sides of the closet, and raising a
great dust. The Judge's wife looked from Pride
to Vanity, then from Ophir to Morocco. As the
clothes shook and rustled, as the silver and the
old-fashioned jewelry jingled, as the foot-gear
banged and rattled, Ruth began to sing and
dance, and the lady nodded her head to keep
time; and then the Judge caught the movement
and beat time with his foot, and whistled an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
tune; and then the baby woke up, clapped his
hands, and cooed with delight.</p>

<p>But time was passing very quickly, and there
was a great deal to do before midnight came or
the east wind arose. So Ruth hurried the closets
along in their march before the guests.</p>

<p>"'Valentine,' 'Argentine,' 'Serpentine,' 'Clementine,'
and 'Turpentine,' come along with you," she
shouted urgently. These were the five closets
which belonged to the Judge's library. Valentine
had nothing but broken furniture in him;
Argentine was loaded down with old and useless
silver (plated ware) and like stuff; Serpentine
contained aged newspapers and magazines; Clementine
was pretty well filled with a variety of
dolls, and they played merrily as the closet came
into the room, and stood first on one foot and
then on the other; Turpentine brought a good
deal of dust with him. He used to hold the
Judge's private papers. They were dry as dust.
The Judge was so interested in the baby that
he paid no attention to the closets.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to call the closet with the skeleton
in it," whispered Ruth. "We named him the
'Wandering Jew;' we've never seen him, you
know. Somebody told us that the key was lost,
and then the keyhole, and finally the closet itself,
and it must be so; for where that closet
was in your day there isn't anything now." During
this remark Mrs. "Judge" looked very restless
and sorrowful. "I just want to see what a
skeleton in the closet is like. I've heard that
every family has got one, but they keep them
out of sight. Wandering Jew, Wandering Jew,"
whispered Ruth with suppressed excitement; and
almost on the instant the lost closet walked into
the room from nowhere. He was quite small;
as he walked something rattled in him. The
child shivered. Was it the skeleton? and would
she see it? Then she remembered that the key
and the keyhole were both lost.</p>

<p>"What's in it?" whispered Ruth. And then
she noticed for the first time that the lady was
weeping. There was a strange silence. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
"Judge" put her hands upon Ruth's head, and
looking down pathetically into her eager eyes
said gently, "I would rather not put any questions
to the Wandering Jew, or try to make
him say anything. Let him pass along out of
my sight." And Ruth, who was quite awed by
the grief of Mrs. "Judge," told the closet to hurry
out of sight as soon as possible. So she never
knew whether it was blasted hopes or withered
love, or the ghost of a chance or the dry bones
of scholarship, or something else that was locked
in that strange little haunted room.</p>

<p>And now the closets were hurried along as fast
as Ruth could name them. But Mrs. "Judge"
seemed to have lost her interest. The closet
with a skeleton in it had thrown her off her
balance. She had little or nothing to say to
any of the others; and Ruth herself grew tired,
so that she was very glad when they had all
made their bows and said their short say, and
something else might be done for the entertainment
of her company.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">The Procession of Goat, Dog, Cat, Bicycles,<br />
Closets, Portraits, Ruth, and The<br />
"Little Judge."</span></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop3-i.jpg" width="140" height="216" alt="I"/>
</div>
<div class='drop-cap'>I THINK it would be real nice for us to
take a little ride about the town, don't
you?" Ruth was speaking to the
Judge and his wife.</div>

<p>"Yes, I think I am rested enough
to go a short way," was the lady's
reply. "But what shall we do with the Judge
and the baby?"</p>

<p>"Why, take them along with us!" Ruth was
always ingenious, and she had plans for every
occasion.</p>

<p>"I think we might take a ride in the closets."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Mrs. "Judge."</p>

<p>"I am going to hitch up the closets and have
a procession," exclaimed Ruth. "You leave it
to me and it'll come out all
right. I'll call the cat and
the goat and 'Turk,' and tell
them to get out the bicycles
and fasten them to the closets,
all in a row, and then
they shall take us to ride."
On any other occasion or
under other circumstances
this would have
appeared a curious
arrangement, but
to-night it was
quite in keeping
with all that had
happened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/p114.png" width="373" height="580" alt="goat chewing on wreath" />
</div>

<p>"Here Billy, Billy, Billy, Turk, Turk, come
Kitty, come Kitty," cried Ruth; and the goat
appeared on the minute, and with him Satan the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
black cat and with him "Turk," the bird-dog.
"You must hitch up the bicycles, and hitch on
the closets, and take us a-riding," ordered Ruth.
Now, Billy was an obliging goat, although his
taste was not of the best; for when one of the
neighbors died, and crape and flowers were hung
on the front door, he went over and climbed up
to the interesting objects, and ate both the cloth
and the wreath. He lacked taste, but he did
enjoy running up and down the street. Satan,
the black cat, was very fond of Ruth, and would
do anything she told him when he didn't want
to do anything else, and he knew what she was
talking about. Turk was always on hand ready
for a frolic.</p>

<p>So Billy, Satan, and Turk got the bicycles fastened
together; and then Ruth called out the
names of the closets, beginning with the very
smallest in the house. The goat and the cat
took a spool of red cotton-thread, and tied all
the closets in a row or a tow (just as you see
boats in a row and a tow when a tug pulls them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
up the river). When all was ready, Billy and
Satan and Turk took their places at the head
of the procession, and stood waiting for their
passengers.</p>

<p>"I think we had better put the baby in the
first closet," said Ruth. "That is the smallest,
you know, and he will fit in like a bug in a rug."</p>

<p>"What have you got to put around him?"
inquired the lady. There had been a slight
fall of snow in the evening, and then it had
turned cold. "I'm afraid he will get chilly,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'll wrap him up in an envelope. Paper
is very warm, I've heard. I'll just put him into
the envelope, and then cut two holes for his eyes,
and then seal him up like a letter." So the
"Little Judge" was fixed. But it occurred to Mr.
Judge at this point that his wife was not prepared
for winter. She was a delicate person, and
she wore the same clothes that she had on when
her portrait was painted. The cap with frilled
border was very pretty, but it was not warm.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear," said the Judge to his wife, "you
are not properly clad for a ride."</p>

<p>"I've got plenty of clothes and things in my
pocket," said Ruth. "Now, here is a nice postage-stamp
with a picture of the queen upon
it. That will do for a bonnet. I'll stick it
on tight." And she did. "Here is a lot of
red crinkly paper that we use to make lamp-shades.
I'll do her up like a bundle from the
store. There, doesn't she look well?" And the
child wound the bright paper all about the matronly
form of Mrs. "Judge," and fastening it
under her chin with a big safety pin, stood off
and admired the brilliant result. "There won't
any cold creep in through that red stuff," exclaimed
Ruth. "Isn't she pretty?" But the
Judge only smiled and looked interested.</p>

<p>"Now you must be fixed," and Ruth turned
toward the Judge. "I'll tie this handkerchief
over your head, and use a piece of red thread for
a muffler. And here is a nice white canton-flannel
bag in my pocket that Herbert has used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for his marbles. You jump into that, and I'll
tie you up."</p>

<p>"But how shall we get down into the closets?"
The Judge seemed perplexed.</p>

<p>"Fall down, of course," exclaimed the child.
"And I'm going to wear mother's feather-bed.
Then, if it 'thunders and lightens' I won't be
afraid." So at length everything was ready, and
they stood on the weight of the clock, and went
down to the door which swung open into the
west parlor; and then they tumbled out into the
room, and made their way to the front piazza
like boys engaged in a bag-race. And there
before the house stood the procession of the
closets.</p>

<p>"What's become of the old portico?" asked
the lady. "You must have made it into this
long sitting-place." She glanced up and down
the roomy piazza. "What color do you call
this?" she asked, referring to the brown paint
upon the house. "We always had it white."</p>

<p>"This color doesn't show the dirt," said Ruth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
"All the dust of the town flies this way, mother
says." At that moment there was a rumbling,
hissing, and flashing in the distance. The house
shook and the sky brightened. Was it an earthquake,
or what?</p>

<p>"My dear," whispered Mrs. "Judge," "I feel
a little timid. I think it's because I've been in
the picture so long. I'm shaking all over. It
seems to me as if something dreadful was going
to happen. What is that awful noise; and I
see strange flames of pale blue light shoot into
the sky."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be scared!" said Ruth; "that's nothing
but the trolley. See, there it comes!" Down the
street towards them swept a thing of light, shaking
the very earth beneath, and speeding past into
the night like some meteor. It was several seconds
before the lady was able to speak.</p>

<p>"Child, what did you say it was?" and she
trembled with fright.</p>

<p>"Why, it's the trolley-car. We ride on it. It
runs by electricity, the same as lightning." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Ruth popped her head in and out of the feather-bed
as she replied, the feathers sticking to her hair and
fluttering about her face in a most comical way.</p>

<p>"I think we'd better start before another car
comes, for Billy and Satan might run away. Sometimes
they're afraid."</p>

<p>"Yes, let us get right into our places," said
the Judge, who was sorry to see his wife distressed.
So the baby rolled into the little closet next to
the seven bicycles, and Ruth jumped into the
next one, and the Judge and his wife shuffled
into the third.</p>

<p>"I think we must make a real funny show,"
exclaimed Ruth, as she lifted her head out of the
feathers again, and gave orders to Billy and Satan
and Turk.</p>


<p>"Get up there, boys!" she said to this remarkable
team. And then they were all in motion,&mdash;the
billy-goat and the black cat and the dog, the seven
bicycles, the little closet with the baby in the blue
envelope, the second closet with Ruth in a feather-bed,
the third closet with the Judge in a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
flannel-bag and a handkerchief over his head, and
Mrs. "Judge," done up in red paper, wearing a
postage stamp for a bonnet, followed by fifty-seven
closets of all shapes, sizes, patterns, conditions.
There was a banging of wood, a slamming of doors,
a creaking of windows, a dancing of shoes, a rattling
of dishes, a rustling of clothes (starched
clothes), a fluttering of sermons, a pounding of pots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and kettles and pans, a rolling about of fruit
glasses and jelly jars and canned food, a falling
of hams, and a rising of flour, and a decline in
vegetables simply frightful.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 604px;">
<img src="images/p121.png" width="604" height="530" alt="dog, cat, goat pulling bicycles and long train of closets" />
</div>

<p>"This is a very fine road," observed the Judge.
"It's just as smooth as a floor. What an improvement
over the roads in our day!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Ruth as she peered out from her
feathers, "we are very proud of our roads. They
are&mdash;what is it you call them? Adam, cadam, oh!
I've got it now, macadam roads. They cost thousands
of dollars. But we've some very good men
in town, just the kind you are, I suppose, and
they've given us miles and miles of it. You
ought to see how we skim along the road now on a
bicycle. It would fairly make your head swim."</p>

<p>"My head does swim," whispered Mrs. "Judge."
"It's so long since I took a ride in the fresh air, and
I've staid such a time in the picture and become so
stiff, that the motion makes me dizzy. I think we'd
better stop for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"What is this?" exclaimed the Judge. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
had gone only to the corner of the Green. There
was a very thin covering of fluffy snow on the
ground. Suddenly the clouds broke away, and the
moon flooded the scene with light. And there,
standing distinct and stately against the black background,
glistening and shimmering in the mild radiance,
was the church.</p>

<p>"Where is the old meeting-house?" and the
Judge rubbed his eyes, and got the handkerchief
loose upon his head; and Mrs. "Judge" in her agitation
dislocated the postage-stamp that served for
a bonnet so that she felt a cold draught in her
left ear.</p>

<p>"Why, Judge, we aren't here, are we? We must
be somewhere else." Then Ruth uncovered her
head, and let a few feathers fly back in the face of
her guest and laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"That's the new church. Our new stone church.
Isn't it lovely? Did you ever see anything like
it? Whoa, Billy and Satan and Turk! Wait a
minute! We want to take a look at things."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you have another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
meeting-house, do you? What's become of the old
one?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that was set on fire. You ought to've
seen it burn. Father said it was the saddest, beautifulest
sight he ever saw. It was like a church
built of fire; and it blazed away,&mdash;walls, roof, floor,
all glorious without and within, and then it was
caught up into heaven, so father says. It made us
think of Elijah going up in his flaming chariot.
And then we built this stone church. Don't you
like it? Why, of course you do; why, I heard
father say that you wanted a stone church, and
gave something for one."</p>

<p>"Like it, child, of course we like it! And we did
want a stone church, and we tried to get the folks
to build one, but they thought they weren't rich
enough. Like it! why this is one of the happiest
moments of my life. What a striking building it
is!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and there is some of your money in it, for
I've heard father say so. They got pay for the old
church when it burned, and that went right into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
new. And it was an English company that had to
pay the insurance; and folks said it was no more
than right that the English should pay it, for they
burned down the one in 1779 when they burnt up
the town, you know."</p>

<p>"You know a great deal about history and
things, don't you?" It was Mrs. "Judge" that
made the pleasing remark.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know many things. It's because I ask
so many questions, I suppose. But mother says I
lack 'capacity.' I don't know what she means;
it's something dreadful, I suppose. Perhaps I'll
make it up when I get big. Wouldn't you like to
stop at the church and go inside? I've got a key
right here in my pocket. Samuel and I carry
keys to about everything."</p>

<p>"I think we might take a little rest here," said
the Judge. "Do you think the team will stand?"
And his eyes twinkled curiously as he looked out
upon Billy and Satan and Turk.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! they'll be all right. If they get tired
of waiting they can take a short run on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
bicycles. Go up there to the front door. 'Whoa!'"
This was said to the team. When they came to
a stop Ruth tumbled out first, then the Judge and
his lady followed, scuffing along as best they could.
They unlocked the door; and Ruth rolled back to
the first closet, picked up the envelope with the
baby in it, tucked him into the feather-bed by
her side, and returned to the vestibule. They
observed that the church was all lighted and
warm. So Ruth slipped off the feather-bed, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a thousand feathers stuck to her, making
the child appear like a new kind of overgrown
fowl. The Judge took the baby on his arm, for
he had also slipped out of Herbert's marble bag,
and then Ruth led them through the building.
Every part was explained,&mdash;the windows, the
organ, the gaslights, the carved pillars, the glass
screen, the chapel, the piano, the library, the parlor,
the furnaces; everything was noted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 601px;">
<img src="images/p126.png" width="601" height="413" alt="Dog, cat and goat riding bicycles" />
</div>

<p>"Why, how lovely it is to be warm in meeting,"
said Mrs. "Judge." "You know we used to have
foot-stoves, or hot baked potatoes, or a piece of
stone. That was all."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that they gave you hot
baked potatoes with butter in meeting, and that
was the way you kept warm?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we didn't eat them!" interrupted Mrs.
"Judge." "We held them in our hands, or put
them to our feet. But the little stoves were
better. And then finally we had stoves, big stoves,
in the meeting-house. I thought I should faint
dead away when they first used them. It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to me so hot and stuffy in the room. And then
I remember that my husband laughed at me when
I drove home (I always had to ride, child; I wasn't
able to walk so far for many years); for he said
there hadn't been any fires kindled yet in the new
stoves. But I got used to them after a time, and
they were real comfortable. But I should certainly
faint away to see the heat coming right up
out of the floor, and think that underneath me
was a raging fire."</p>

<p>"Why that's the way we warm the parsonage,"
said Ruth. "Didn't you see the registers?"</p>

<p>"Have you got one of those fires in the cellar?"
asked Mrs. "Judge."</p>

<p>"Dear me, Judge, I shall never feel safe again
so long as we hang on the east parlor wall. Why,
we shall be liable to burn up any moment. Think
of having one of those awful things, full of fire,
right under your feet. I'm so sorry that I know
anything about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll get used to it! You have got used
to it, haven't you? There has been a furnace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the parsonage ever so many years." They were
all seated in the minister's pew in church at this
time. The Judge was bowed in thought.</p>

<p>"He looks as if he was going to pray," whispered
Ruth, somewhat awe-struck by his expression
and the stillness of the place as well as the solemnity
of the occasion. But it was hard for her to
keep from asking questions. "Did you see the
man in the moon as we came into church?" she
turned to Mrs. "Judge."</p>

<p>"The man in the moon!" exclaimed the lady;
"he's the very person that I want to speak to.
I think it's years since I've seen him."</p>

<p>"Well, he's out to-night in great style. It must
be because it's Christmas Eve. Did you hang up
your stocking when you were a little girl?"</p>

<p>"Do what?" inquired the lady.</p>

<p>"Hang up your stocking, to be sure, for Santa
Claus to fill it with presents." The Judge's wife
looked with astonishment upon the child by her
side. It was impossible for her to imagine what
was meant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing," she replied.
Then Ruth enlightened her.</p>

<p>"You know that Jesus was born on the twenty-fifth
of December?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child."</p>

<p>"And you know God gave him to the world?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you think it's nice for us to give
things to each other on that day? and don't you
believe that Santa Claus comes down the chimney
and brings us lots of presents?"</p>

<p>"Why, I never thought of it." And the dear
old lady began to think a good deal about it.</p>

<p>"We keep it right here in church too. We
have a Christmas-tree, and sing carols, and all
the children get presents and candy, and ever so
many nice things; and everybody is just as happy
as can be. Don't you think that is a nice way to
remember the coming of Jesus and God's gift to
all of us?"</p>

<p>"Well! well! well! and so to-night is the very
night, is it? Judge, did you know that our folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
now keep Christmas in their churches and their
homes? Do you think there is any sin in it?"
He was startled out of his reverie by the question,
and Ruth was obliged to explain to him what
she had said to his wife. Then he thought upon
it for a little time, and replied to Mrs. "Judge."
It pleased him. He wished to see what it was
like. "Why, I think, my dear, that it might be
made a very happy, helpful festival. Why couldn't
we have one over at the house to-night?"</p>

<p>"We are going to have one there in the morning,"
exclaimed Ruth. "We all get up bright
and early, and our stockings are filled, and there
is a little tree, and candles, and oranges, and
shiny balls, and beautiful things; and we dance
around, and sing, and have oh! such a happy,
happy time. I wish you would stay and see
it."</p>

<p>"My dear," the Judge was now speaking to his
wife, "don't you think you could get up a little
party for the children to-night? We can't stay
until morning, you know. We must go back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the pictures. And the east wind may rise at any
hour."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/p132.png" width="368" height="431" alt="moon above a shadowy figure" />

<p>"Judge, I'll step out a moment and speak with
the man in the moon. He's out to-night, Ruth
says, and perhaps we can arrange something.
I'll be back very
soon." So she
walked down the
aisle, and passed
into the vestibule
with all the liveliness
of a young
dame.</p>

<p>"I think this
must be the very
spot where I used
to sit in the meeting."
The Judge
was talking to himself as much as to Ruth. "I
wonder what they did with the old box pew that
belonged to me? How times have changed! But
this is very rich and dignified, and satisfies me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
As this was said he surveyed the chaste and elegant
interior with approving eye. "I am glad to
see it. But I wish it had been in my day. There
are some ideas that I should like to have embodied
in stone on this spot. Strange world this." And
then he bowed his head in thought again.</p>

<p>"I'm going to meet Mrs. 'Judge,'" said Ruth,
"unless you will stand up and make a speech to
me. Do you think you are as good and wise and
great as people say? I've heard father tell how
you could speak better'n any minister or lawyer
in New England. Could you? Because I'd like
to hear you if you could." The Judge blushed to
hear such praise.</p>

<p>"I'm out of practice," he replied. "I believe
my voice has lost itself. It's very trying on the
vocal organs to hang in a picture for a hundred
years or so. But I will say a few words." Then
the Judge walked up into the pulpit, made a
very graceful bow, and began to recite psalms.
His voice was remarkably rich and sympathetic.
He put so much soul into the words that Ruth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
sat perfectly still, a thing she had never been
known to do before in all her life. Had it not
been for the floating about of feathers as she
breathed, and drove them hither and thither, she
would have appeared like one dead. When the
Judge finished he came down from the pulpit,
and Ruth was so overcome that she didn't say
one word for as much as a minute and one half.
Then the spell was broken. Mrs. "Judge" came
hastily in, saying that she was ready to go, and
the team had just returned from their run on
the bicycles; then they all came out of church,
and the organ played, and the bell rang, and the
gas fixtures jingled, and when the company was
fixed in their closets they continued on the ride.</p>

<p>"Did you see the man in the moon?" inquired
Ruth.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" replied Mrs. "Judge"; "I've made
all the arrangements; and when we get back the
house will be ready, and we'll wake up the children,
and it will be our first real Christmas party.
I am going to invite only the closets and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
children. I want to get the closets all filled up
again for once; and then I want to see every
one of you children so full of happiness that
you'll run over and make other people happy
too."</p>

</div>

<p>As they were passing the Town Hall the Judge
was again reminded of old times; for that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the very place where he had argued many of his
cases, and won some of his greatest victories.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "I could almost imagine
we were set back to the War of 1812, and I was
going over to the Court House to express my
views to our citizens."</p>

<p>"It looks as though they'd done something to
the building," remarked the lady. "How they
change everything these days!" And then they
swung down Beach Lane, and came to the old
cemetery.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" exclaimed Ruth. "Isn't it
fine?" She referred to the thick, solid, stone wall
enclosing the grounds, and the beautiful lich-gate
that stood over the entrance.</p>

<p>"We're right up to the times here," continued
the child. "The Daughters of the American Revolution
and some of our ladies did that. We
can sit on those stone seats hot summer days,
and it's just as cool as cool can be. And it's
such a nice place to play 'hide-and-seek' behind
the grave-stones and the wall among the trees."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, this is what I love to see," observed
the Judge. "This shows the true spirit of reverence.
I am proud of these good Daughters.
What did you say they were called? Daughters
of the American Revolution? Why, they must
all be dead by this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" explained Ruth; "these are their
daughter's daughters, you know. And they have
such good times. Why, mother is going to their
meetings a good deal of the time. They talk
about the Revolution and things, and wear flags
and pins, and have refreshments and papers, and
elect officers, and get up plays, and go to Washington,
and keep inviting each other somewhere,
and all the while say ever so much about Washington's
Birthday and the Fourth of July and
the Battle of Lexington. Why, we children know
so much about history that it seems sometimes
as if we'd lived all through the whole fight, and
seen the town burned, and helped drive the British
away. Don't you think we're smart?"</p>

<p>"I shall have to be very careful how I talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
about these things, or you will catch me in some
mistake, I suppose." The Judge looked serious,
but there was that funny twinkle in his eyes.
"Suppose we now drive around the new cemetery,
and see if everything is as trim and neat
there. We'd like to look at our own graves,
and see how things are."</p>

<p>"Well, I think that's a very unpleasant way
to spend Christmas Eve; and I'm sure that Billy
and Satan and Turk will be afraid to go into
that place, and so shall I; and you can't see
much from the road; so let's drive up to Round
Hill, and watch for Santa Claus."</p>

<p>"Oh! just as you please," continued the Judge.
"This is your circus, not mine." And he smiled
indulgently upon Ruth. So they turned about
on the Beach Road, and slipped up to Round
Hill. While they were viewing the scenery, the
man in the moon winked at Mrs. "Judge," as
much as to say that the house was all ready,
and it was time for the party to return.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div>

</div>
<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN they returned to the parsonage,
Billy unhitched himself and
opened the front door. The Judge
and his wife with Ruth and the
baby hastened into the warm
rooms as fast as the feather-bed, the white flannel
bag, the blue envelope, and the red paper would
permit them.</div>

<p>"Why, what a change there is here!" exclaimed
Ruth. "It must be exactly as you used to have it."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. "Judge"; "I told the man
in the moon to make things look natural. This
seems really like coming home. I feel very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
as I did whenever I drove down to New York, and
came back to the dear house. It is so nice to see
these beautiful carpets again, and the same chairs
and tables and sofas; the very damask curtains
I made; my little sewing-stand; the clock right
there in its place near my bedroom door; and
there is the refrigerator. I always had it stand
in my bedroom, you know. That made it very
convenient. And I kept all the stores in"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Me," groaned Darkest Africa, who still remained
in front of the house awaiting the orders
of Ruth.</p>

<p>"Yes, in you," continued Mrs. "Judge"; "and
I expect to see you very happy again to-night. I
never kept Christmas. We didn't approve of such
things when I was a child." She was now talking
to Ruth. "But if they have a Christmas-tree
in the meeting-house, and the minister thinks it's
all right, it must be so. I am really quite glad to
get up a party to-night. I shall have it to think
about when I go back into the picture. And that
reminds me, child, that I want you to come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the parlor very often and speak to me. It's very
very lonely staying there day and night, summer
and winter, year in and year out. Why don't you
ask the Judge and me to play church with you
and the rest of the children some of the times
when you come into the parlor?"</p>

<p>"Why, I never thought of that!" exclaimed
Ruth. "I'll do it the very next time (which
will be Sunday, I suppose) that we have church
again." By this time they had taken their wraps
off and put them up. That is to say, Ruth got
out of the feather-bed, and had Turk carry it
up-stairs, while she took the handkerchief and
the marble-bag off from the Judge, and the postage-stamp
and the red crinkly paper off from
Mrs. "Judge," and put these things in her pocket.
Then they all went into the lady's chamber, and
took the baby out of the envelope, laying him
on the bed, and covering him with a soap-dish and
a hair-brush to keep him warm, for he had gone
to sleep.</p>

<p>"Now we must get ready for the party," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Ruth, "and then I'll call the children and dress
them. But, dear me! what will you and the
Judge wear? We've got tired of seeing you in
the same clothes all the time. Oh, I'll tell you!
Let's play dress up just as we children do, and
then I can fix you out in fine style."</p>

<p>"Just as you say, child. It's your party, and
you can do much as you please. And the truth
is that I am pretty tired of wearing the same
clothes all these many years. I don't think it
makes so much difference to a man. But we
women like to have something new once in a
while, say once in fifty or seventy-five years."</p>

<p>"Oh! won't it be fun?" cried Ruth. "We'll
have 'Providence' come in here and show us
what he's got in him. You know Providence is
the big closet in the corner of the Betsey-Bartram
room. Come here, Providence." This closet
ambled into the bedroom, and Mrs. "Judge" took
a silver candlestick with a wax candle in her
hand, and stepped into the closet followed by the
Judge and Ruth. What a medley of stuff they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
found! There were silks and satins of all colors
and kinds. There was velvet and calico, lawn
and broadcloth, furs and flowers, laces and linens,
swallow-tail coats and fancy vests, a waterproof,
a riding-habit, bicycle suits, pajamas, flags and
bunting, forming an infinite assortment or mixture
of everything under the sun in the shape
of dry goods.</p>

<p>"You don't keep an old-clothes exchange, do
you, child?" asked the astonished visitor.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! these are mother's treasures (that's
what she calls them). We get 'em when her
ship comes in. It always seems to come in the
night. We children have watched for it ever
since we lived West and could remember. But
the first we know is that mother tells us some
day how the ship has come in, and another cargo
has been unloaded in Providence. Then we all
make a rush and overhaul the cargo; one thing
fits one child, and another thing fits another
child, and what doesn't fit we make over, and
then we appear in our new outfits. You ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to see us go into church a week or two after a
fresh cargo of treasures has been distributed. It's
great fun." During this talk Ruth was rummaging
about in the trunks or on the shelves
in search of something becoming to her guests.</p>

<p>"I think the Judge ought to have something
solemn on, don't you?" she said, addressing his
wife. "Now, this long, black waterproof is the
thing. And he can wear Samuel's bicycle stockings
and shoes. Then, here's a broad purple ribbon
for a necktie; and I'll put this ermine boa around
his neck, for don't judges sometimes wear ermine?
Doesn't he look cute?" She had helped him on
with the things while Mrs. "Judge" stood by smiling
her approval.</p>

<p>"I think this green velvet waist and this red
silk skirt will look well on you." Ruth was
speaking to the lady. "Then I'll do your hair
up with this white lace and these yellow flowers.
It's so cold I think you had better wear mittens.
I think you ought to have a train to your dress.
I'll take some safety-pins, and fasten a few yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of this white satin on behind. Doesn't it look
elegant? You must have a corsage bouquet."
And she twisted up some dry grasses and pink
roses, and pinned them to her belt. "And this
white gauze veil will add to the effect." So it
was spread over the lady's head, and fell in scant
folds across her brow.</p>

<p>"I shall get into this pink crape," Ruth continued,
"slip these muffs up my ankles, and take
this black fur cape and that lovely, lovely lavender
bonnet. I'm going to wear white kid gloves,
and have a train of that yellow satin. Will you,
please, tie this bow of nile-green velvet about my
neck? And I must have a veil too. This one
with little red spots like the measles all over it
will suit me, I guess. There, now, don't I look
just too nice for anything?" Both the Judge
and his wife bowed and smiled.</p>

<p>"I'll put this black lace one side for the baby
when he wakes up. We'll dress him up with
that and some tissue paper I've got in my pocket.
And now let's go and take a look at the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
again." But their talking roused the baby; so
they dressed him as Ruth had planned, winding
the paper and lace about his body as though he
were a mummy; and then they started for the
parlor, the Judge carrying his namesake on one
arm and supporting his wife on the other, with
Ruth dragging on behind, clinging to the right
hand of Mrs. "Judge."</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs Ruth proposed that
she go and call all the children. For at this late
hour they had gone to bed. But the visitors
thought it better to wait.</p>

<p>"We must ask a few questions and find out
what the children want for Christmas," said Mrs.
"Judge." So they passed into the parlor, and sat
down on the Grecian sofa. A soft, gentle light
fell from the astral lamp and the wax candles
on the mantle-piece. The wood fire on the hearth,
the heavy damask curtains at the windows, the
rich mahogany furniture scattered about through
the room, the handsome pictures upon the walls,
gave the place a very inviting appearance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Ruth, we're going to put something in
each child's stocking." Mrs. "Judge" was speaking.
"It seems to me a foolish custom, but now
that you all do it we will follow suit. Tell us
what to get."</p>

<p>"Father says there's a difference between what
we want and what we need. We want a great
many things, but we need only a few."</p>

<p>"That's sound talk," observed the Judge.
"Your father must be quite a man."</p>

<p>"Oh!" was the reply, "he weighs almost a
hundred and ninety pounds. I heard mother tell
the teacher the other day that she thought I
lacked capacity. I don't get along in school at
all. There are so many things to do besides study
that it takes all my time. I think mother would
be pleased if you gave me something of the kind.
That's what I need I suppose. But what I want
is to know about everything. That's why I ask
so many questions and tease to go all the time.
I'm trying to find out things for myself. How
should I learn how old a girl or a lady is if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I didn't ask? And what's my tongue for if it
isn't to use in talking?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," replied Mrs. "Judge." "But
I used my tongue for eating too, until I got into
the picture. I think it's almost a hundred years
since I had anything to eat."</p>

<p>"Mercy! aren't you hungry?" exclaimed Ruth.
"But you don't look thin, and you certainly don't
grow old. I've heard folks say so when they
looked at your picture. 'Why, how nice and
fresh and lifelike they seem.' That's what our
visitors say when we take them into the parlor
to see the portraits. But, dear me, we shall never
get through the list if I keep on talking. I can't
help talking. I seem made for it. I've heard
father say that several of his family were deaf,
but none of 'em were ever dumb." The Judge
and his wife appeared quite interested in this
lively flow of speech on the part of the child, so
they nodded their heads with encouragement, and
Ruth continued.</p>

<p>"Now, there's Helen, she's always talking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
writing a book. I think she wants to write a
book above all things. You might give her the
book she is going to write. But what she really
needs is curls. That straight black hair makes
her look horrid. I wish you'd bring her a whole
lot of curls. Isn't it queer that we can't have
a baby with curls? We've had a regular cry
over it more than once. Not a single curl in all
the fifteen. Every hair of our heads as straight
as a string. Don't you think you'd better write
the things down as I tell them to you? But
then you've got such an awful memory I suppose
you can remember everything. Now, there's
Samuel. You tell him two things and father
says he's sure to forget three. Mother says if his
memory was as good as his forgetery, he'd make
something remarkable."</p>

<p>"I think if you will lend me a piece of paper,&mdash;that
red crinkly stuff that the baby has on,&mdash;and
a stick of candy or a poker, I will write down the
articles you mention." It was the Judge speaking.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you take the quill and the paper
that you hold in the portrait, and use them?"
inquired Ruth.</p>

<p>"To be sure!" exclaimed the Judge. "What
a bright girl you are!"</p>

<p>"Father doesn't think so. I don't know how
many times he's said to me when I've done something
queer, 'Ruth, you don't seem to have any
sense.' Susie said one day, 'Well, I'll give her
my two cents.' And she did, and I spent it for
candy. Father would be so pleased if you gave
me some sense for a Christmas present, I know."
The visitors smiled as the child prattled, and let
her continue without interruption.</p>

<p>"I know what Samuel wants. I know a lot
of things he wants. Mother says he always wants
to go home with the girls. But you couldn't call
that a present, could you? Oh! I know one
thing he wants very much. Whenever he tries
to race with any of the boys, and he comes out
a long way behind, he says he wants wind. Just
put that down, please. But I think the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
he needs most of anything is courtesy. At least
father keeps talking to him about it. If you
would bring a big lot of it I'm sure we'd all
be pleased. It must be something very nice, for
father says something about it every day of his
life." The Judge nodded his head, and wrote
with his quill upon the sheet of paper. "Theodora
is always wanting clothes. She's never had
enough. I don't know how many times we've
heard her say she had nothing to wear. And
then father says she'd better go to bed. I wonder
if she'll have all the clothes she wants in
heaven?" Neither the Judge nor his lady ventured
to answer. "What Theodora really needs,
I think, is a gold spoon. Mother says she was
certainly born with a gold spoon in her mouth;
but the spoon has been lost, for I've never seen
it, and it would be such a nice thing to give
her one in its place. Or, maybe, you could bring
her the very one she had when she was born.
I should like to see what kind of a spoon it
was." So the Judge put that down.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's easy enough to tell what Ethel wants.
She's always talking about it. She wants some
<em>new</em> clothes. She says she's sick to death of
second-hand stuff. Mother's always having something
made over for her or some of the younger
girls. We've never seen anything real fresh and
new. Father says we ought to be thankful to
have clothes at all. I suppose we had. What
Ethel needs is application. Her teacher says so,
and so does everybody else. She doesn't stick
to a thing."</p>

<p>"Poor child," said the Judge. "She'll have
a hard time, I fear. I'll see what we can do
for her."</p>

<p>"Now, Miriam hasn't any gumption, father
says. I wonder what that is? I think that
must be the thing she needs the most. She's
such a chicken-hearted girl Samuel says. And
that makes me think what it is Miriam always
wants. She tells mother, I don't know how many
times a day, that she wishes she'd have some
spring chicken. You don't know how fond she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is of 'em. But they're very high here, you know.
And spring chickens enough to go around in such
a family as ours would soon ruin us, mother
says. But Ethel is so fond of them. How she
wants 'em! Do you think you could fill her
up for once?"</p>

<p>"Why, spring chickens are not in my line of
treasures, my child; but I might find something
that would take the place of such fowls."</p>

<p>"Henry says Elizabeth's a regular old goose.
And Samuel calls Susie 'duckie.' I wonder if
you couldn't help Grace. She needs balance,
everybody says. I think she's smart enough,
but she's a high-flyer. You never can tell what
will happen next when she's around. Please
bring some balance for a present. But what
she wants is Frederick. He's the boy in the
next block. I don't think it's right to think
so much of boys unless they're your brothers.
Elizabeth says her brothers are her bothers.
And I think so too." Ruth looked very severe.
The Judge simply continued his writing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think you could bring all of us a
very great deal of sweetness of disposition? I've
heard so much about that thing that I'm real
tired of it; but I know it would please both father
and mother, for they have talked about it ever
since I can remember. I know a little baby
girl down South who is so sweet they call her
'Sugar.' Samuel says if we named our children
as they ought to be named, some of them would
be called 'Vinegar.' But he's 'funning,' I guess.
Mother says his bark is always worse than his
bite.</p>

<p>"Now, George needs heart. Samuel says George
will never die of heart disease, because he hasn't
any heart. He has a gun, and Elizabeth calls
him Nimrod. He wants to go to war. But
we're afraid he might get shot in the back. But
he's a real good boy after all. I should hate
to see him going around with a hole in his back."
Just at this point the Judge coughed and looked
queer.</p>

<p>"Henry is crazy about music. He wants a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
violin, but mother says he needs an ear for music.
I should like to know what he'd do with a third
ear. Would you put it on the top of his head?
And he wants to sing; but, dear me, father says
he needs a voice. He has voice enough, <em>I</em> think.
You can hear him all over town. Did you write
it down?" Ruth looked keenly at the Judge as
his pen flew with the speed of a snail over the
paper.</p>

<p>"Yes, here it is in white and black."</p>

<p>"Now, William is an awfully forward boy.
He's so forward father says that he's growing
round-shouldered. He wants to be President.
That's ever since he went to the White House
with mother. It was a very cold day, the day
he went; and William had his mittens on, and
mother couldn't get to him to take 'em off when
he shook hands with the President. Neighbors
say that what he needs is training. But they
don't train now as they used to. Father says
they used to train out here on the Green several
times a year. I know the best thing you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
bring William is a training. And Susie, she
wants something she hasn't got. I don't think
it makes any difference what it is. Mother says
if she hasn't got it she wants it. And then she
snivels when she doesn't get it. I heard some
one say the other day that what she needed was
a spanking. But I don't think that would be a
very nice present, do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, not for Christmas, anyway," whispered
Mrs. "Judge."</p>

<p>"There's Nathaniel, he always wants to go
somewhere. Father says that if we lived in Beersheba
Nathaniel would want to move into Dan,
and when he got into Dan he'd be sure to start
the next day for Beersheba. He needs a good
deal of watching, mother says. Samuel, Elizabeth,
Helen, Henry, and Miriam have all got
watches; but you see we can't all have them at
once.</p>

<p>"Now, just look at Elizabeth. You'd think
we all belonged to her, wouldn't you? She
wants to <em>run</em> everything. And then she runs so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
much that mother says she runs down. But
father says she needs experience, and then everything
will come out all right. If you could bring
her that ripe experience that I've heard folks
talk about, I think it would make father and
mother feel real pleased.</p>

<p>"Herbert needs backbone. I felt of his back
the other day, and I didn't see but that he had
just as much bone in it as the rest of the children,
but father says not. Mother says you can twist
him around your little finger. That would be a
queer sight, wouldn't it? Herbert is always talking
about a good time. That's the thing he wants.
Could you bring something of that sort to him?"</p>

<p>"Well, my child," answered the Judge, "I am
thinking about bringing a good time to every one
of you. It's such a pleasure to see the old house
full of children that I should like to do anything
in the world possible to make them happy."
When this was said Mrs. "Judge" beamed an
approval, and seemed very happy herself. "But
you haven't told us what to give the baby."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me, why that's the best of all! But
everybody knows what the baby ought to have.
I've been a-looking to see if you've brought it
along with you. When folks come to see the
baby they smile and trot him on the knee and
kiss him, and then say, 'I'm so glad you named
him for the Judge. He was a good, great man.
May his mantle fall upon his namesake.' And
then they kiss him again and go away. It's
your mantle that we expect you to give the baby.
But you didn't bring it with you, and I'm so sorry.
And it isn't in the picture either. For I've looked
there a great many times. I thought maybe it
was left in the house, but we never hear anything
about it. Now you're right here with the
baby I thought if you only had it you might
give it to him at once. Could you send it to
him? It must be something very fine. Even
father talks about it." A tear stole down the
cheek of the Judge. It was chased by another
and a third. He seemed deeply moved. For the
Judge was human like the rest of folks, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
if he did stay a hundred years in a picture. And
who does not like to be remembered with such
loving words and beautiful praises? Can one
help feeling kindly and grateful? The Judge's
voice choked with emotion as he replied to the
noble sentiments of the child. It was very hard
for him to express himself.</p>

<p>"My little Ruth," he stooped and looked down
into her face with wondrous and pathetic tenderness,
"you have done me more good than all
that I can do for you. These very words that
you have just spoken are more precious to me
than all the money in the world."</p>

<p>"Why, you don't mean it, do you?" interrupted
the child. "I was saying what everybody
says. I don't know how many times I've
heard father say that your memory was a&mdash;a&mdash;a
benediction, that's the word. A very big word
for such a little girl as I am; but, dear me! I've
heard folks use it so many times about you that
I can speak it all right. It must be something
very good. Why, of course, that's what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
call the end of church service. I think it's the
very best part of going to meeting. I always
feel so happy when they come to the benediction.
I think everybody else does too. And
now about the mantle. Will you send it to the
baby?"</p>

<p>"Why, Ruth, I think it must be pretty nearly
worn out. Only what you say about it, and what
you say others say, makes me think that perhaps
it might be worth saving, so that I could give
it to the baby if folks think best. I'll look it
up and talk with my wife, and perhaps I'll give
it to the dear little fellow. I wish it were a
better mantle, however. I'd like to see him wear
one more worthy than mine."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's time to call the children?"
said Ruth.</p>

<p>"Send Turk," replied the Judge, with that
same funny twinkle in his eye. So Ruth took
the dog, and ran up-stairs and down-stairs and in
the lady's chamber, and wakened the children,
telling them to hurry right down to the party.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 596px;">
<img src="images/p163.png" width="596" height="466" alt="Many children dressed up in long line after Judge carrying a baby and the dog and cat" />
</div>

<p>They didn't have time to dress much. The
boys all put on their trousers and stockings and
slippers, and then they wrapped around them
whatever was most handy. Samuel wore his
father's loud, red, double gown. Henry pulled
on a canvas shooting-jacket. Herbert did himself
up in a rose blanket. George had on an
afghan. Nathaniel brought with him a crazy-quilt.
William got into his mother's golf-cape.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls were a little more particular. They
put on all their clothes except dresses. Then they
wound sheets about themselves, and tied their
heads up in pillow-cases. When the boys tumbled
down-stairs they looked like a lot of escaped lunatics.
When the girls came pushing into the parlor
they made one think of ghosts.</p>

<p>The first thing was a walk around headed by
Turk and the black cat. You couldn't fancy
a more startling procession.</p>

<p>Then they played games, and sang songs, and
told riddles, and looked for a needle in a haystack,
and turned the house upside down and
inside out.</p>

<p>The great event of the party was the supper.
Mrs. "Judge" had told the man in the moon
what she wished for the occasion, and while the
children were rollicking in the east parlor the
clock sounded out the alarm for the feast.</p>

<p>The Judge carried his namesake on the left
arm, while his wife leaned upon his right. Ruth
still kept hold of the lady's hand. The rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the company followed in a good deal of disorder,
for they were all curious to see what sort of a
supper would be given them.</p>

<p>When they came into the west parlor or dining-room
they saw a long table, but there was nothing
on it. The children looked at each other and
at the Judge and his wife in blank amazement.
They expected to sit down to a table laden with
all the goodies of the land. But there wasn't
even a table-cloth before them.</p>

<p>The Judge took the head of the table, and his
wife sat at the foot with Ruth. The baby was
put in a clothes-basket, and sat on my lady's
work-table by the side of the Judge. The other
children took the places that were most convenient
to them.</p>

<p>"Where's the feed?" exclaimed Ruth.</p>

<p>"The what?" replied Mrs. "Judge" curiously.</p>

<p>"Why, the things you were going to give us
to eat." Just then "Dublin," the linen closet,
came meandering into the room, made a bow, and
emptied out a long, white, snowdrop tablecloth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, it must be that we're to set the table
ourselves," cried Ruth, as she started to undo
the cloth and shove it along.</p>

<p>"Here you give that to me, will you?" said
Samuel, with a tone of authority any commanding
officer in the army or navy might envy. Then he
took one end of it, and Elizabeth the other, and
they spread it carefully over the table.</p>

<p>Just then China came rattling into the room
with the dishes. It was easy enough for him to
get into the room; but it was quite another thing
for him to move gracefully about the table, for
China, you remember, was thin, long, and rather
narrow. But he managed to get to the Judge,
and drop a plate before him and the baby; and
then he twisted around like a snake, and got down
to the end of the table, and dropped a plate before
Mrs. "Judge." Then he went from one child
to another, and banged down a plate before each
one of them. After this was done, China stepped
back and stood by the side of Dublin, near the
wall.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>El Dorado came next. He brought the silver,
and there was a fine display of it. Beautiful
knives and forks and spoons for every person
in the room, and ever so many little furnishings
that helped to brighten the table. How these
things rattled and jumped and rang as they were
tumbled hither and thither into their rightful
places. The children didn't have to move a
hand or a finger to put them in order. Every
knife, fork, spoon, salt-cellar, or other article
seemed to know where to go, and got there
in less time than one could say "Jack Robinson."
Then the silver candlesticks from the
mantle jumped over to the table, and took their
places with a good deal of brightness and sprightliness.</p>

<p>At this point the antique sideboard stepped
close up to the table, and rolled seventeen very
thin cut-glass goblets upon the board. They
made a right merry sound as they jingled out
their Christmas greetings.</p>

<p>"Don't let the baby have a goblet!" shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Ruth. "He'd bite a piece right out of it. That's
what Elizabeth did when she was a baby, mother
says. Isn't it a wonder she didn't die?" But
everybody was watching this extraordinary way
of setting the table, so that the child's remark
fell unnoticed. There was a most lively and
musical ringing of bells at this stage of the table
setting. Turpentine came dancing into the room.
Turpentine was the closet in the Judge's study
that had been used to store the church-bells in.
When the last wooden meeting-house had burned
they took the old bell, which rang for the last
time the sad alarm of fire on the memorable night,
and they sent it away to be melted up and made
into five hundred little bells. There were dinner-bells
and tea-bells and call-bells and sleigh-bells
and play-horse bells on lines, and I don't know
how many other kinds. Nearly all of these had
been sold, but thirty or forty remained in the
closet. Turpentine came into the room playing
with these, and rolled one down in front of each
person at the table.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"How would you like to have the dinner served,
Ruth?" inquired Mrs. "Judge."</p>

<p>"Oh, served of course," she replied.</p>

<p>"Bells first course," shouted Samuel. The older
children all snickered. "I think you ought to call
Turpentine 'Bells-ze-bub!'" Samuel whispered
to Helen. "See?" For by this time the children
had all come to a familiar footing with their visitors,
and they were expressing themselves with a
good deal of freedom and having a right good time.</p>

<p>The Refrigerator entered the room now, and
tramping heavily over to Mrs. "Judge," swung
open his door, and flung gracefully upon the table
a big dish of half-shells. No sooner were they
placed where they belonged than they began to
roll about to the different plates, like a lot of
marbles, only they seemed to know how to divide
themselves up so that every one had a proper
share. Then the Refrigerator dumped out another
large dish of something fresh and green; and this
stuff sailed along the table, as one sees seaweed
float back and forth on the tide.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know what it is. They grow down by the
brook. Caresses. Aren't they nice and fresh?"</p>

<p>"Third course, caresses," shouted Samuel. And
then he bent over and kissed the girl next to his
side; the Judge kissed the baby, Ruth kissed Mrs.
"Judge," and the rest of the children kissed each
other.</p>

<p>"Awful sweet course!" exclaimed Henry. "Very
much of it makes a fellow sick."</p>

<p>This was followed by the entrance of the kitchen
closet number one. A fine brass kettle popped out
upon the table. There was a great rattling and
clashing. Everybody tried to look into the bottom
of it.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty kettle of fish," said Samuel, who
was the first to get a glance at the contents. And
sure enough it was; for there were seventeen tin
fishes, such as you see floating around after a magnet
on some basin of water at Christmas time.</p>

<p>"Look out for bones," cried Herbert. "What
next?" And then Vanity came down-stairs, giggling
and simpering, and passed something around.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Crimps," said Ruth, "hot and steaming,
straight from the irons." A very strong odor
of scorched hair pervaded the room.</p>

<p>"Goodness me, what a treat!" exclaimed Henry.
"Give 'em to the girls. They are fond of 'em."
Kitchen closet number two came hurrying into the
room. China rushed forward with bowls which he
had borrowed from the bowling-alley; and each
bowl was filled with bean porridge hot, bean porridge
cold, bean porridge in the pot nine days old.</p>

<p>"Here comes the spring chicken!" exclaimed
Herbert, as the Refrigerator distributed one spring
with chicken attached.</p>

<p>"Do-nots for old-fashioned boys and girls,"
wheezed out Darkest Africa, as he pushed his way
into the room. The company was getting pretty
large, for all the closets had come. One stood behind
each person at the table, and the other forty-three
were pressing against each other, trying to
see the table and hear the conversation, or do any
little waiting upon the merry party.</p>

<p>They were all busy eating, talking, drinking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
having the best time in all the world. There was
an abundance of everything. I don't know what
all. But as the courses were brought on the Judge
and his wife became a little restless. They felt
that the east wind was rising. And when the
clock struck twelve it was necessary for them to
be back in the pictures, whether there was any east
wind or not. So there was some confusion, considerable
crowding, and a good deal of haste during
the latter part of the feast.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the children will get dyspepsia,
Judge," observed the cautious lady. "The children
are eating too fast. The closets are bringing
on too many things at a time."</p>

<p>"Time and tide wait for no man," replied the
Judge, who had caught the hilarity of the company,
and was enjoying every moment of the fun.
"I wish to see this board cleared up before we
clear out." Now, Mrs. "Judge" was the least bit
shocked at such undignified speech on the part of
her husband. But she knew he didn't mean any
harm. He was only entering into the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
frolic. Yet she felt that he ought to set an example
of sober conversation, so that they would
remember him with the highest respect. The
Judge, however, had a sense of humor that could
not be held altogether in check.</p>

<p>"I think we ought to have some toasts," said
Samuel. "All in favor of the nomination say,
'Dickery, dickery dock, the mouse ran up the clock,
the clock ran down, the mouse came down, dickery,
dickery dock;' and Samuel rose to propose the first
toast. Kitchen closet number three came forward,
and put into his hand a nice, big toasting-fork.
Flourishing this about his head, and hitting Henry
on the right ear with it, Samuel lifted a goblet
filled with hot air to his lips, and proposed the
health of the Judge and his wife. The applause
was overwhelming. The children clapped their
hands, and lifted their voices on high. The dishes
jumped like mad. The bells rang so that you
couldn't hear yourself think. The closets creaked
and groaned, and slammed their doors, and shook
their shelves, until it seemed that they must fall in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
pieces. The Judge gathered his waterproof about
him, pulled on his necktie for a moment, cleared
his throat, and then responded.</p>

<p>"Children and closets," he said. The children
all rose and bowed, the closets all turned around
twice and stood on one corner. "This is in some
respects the greatest day of my life."</p>

<p>"You mean night, don't you, Judge?" interrupted
Samuel.</p>

<p>"Oh! I beg pardon, night of my life. Correct,
my son." He bowed good-naturedly to the critic.
"We haven't stayed in those portraits on the east
parlor wall for nothing all these years. We've
been waiting for such a time as this. I think the
east wind is rising, and soon we shall have to go
back to our pictures; but I am glad to say that this
is the sort of family that I always had in mind
when I built this house. It's lonesome to live
without children. This is a strange world. I
have observed generally that the people who want
children don't have them. And the people who
have them don't always want them. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
people who know the most about bringing them
up are the people who never had any, and never
lived in a family of children when they were
young. But I really believe that one never gets
much out of this world except it comes to him
through children. And now I hope that you will
be such children that when you grow to be men
and women we shall not be ashamed of you. My
wife and I expect to stay in the portraits. We
shall always be on the watch for you and sometimes
in the clock. There isn't anything in the
world that would give us such pleasure as to see
you children grow and become the best men and
women in all the nation. I suppose you have
enough boys to make a foot-ball team, and enough
girls to drain a common pocket-book and spread it
all over your backs; but you are going to make
something better than idlers and spendthrifts.
Some of you will take to one thing, and some to
another, but you will all take to the right. I expect
to see you filling up the house with nice
friends, going off to college, and bringing back good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
company and great honors. By and by you will
all settle in life, and have homes of your own; but
we shall keep at home here on the wall, and look
for your frequent visits. Ruth has made me very
happy. I'll tell you how. She has said some of
the things to me that people have said to her about
me,&mdash;kind things, sweet praises, words of happy
remembrance. Now, I hope that you will live and
love in such a true way that when you get into a
picture and stay a hundred years, and then step
down and out for a little while, people will say
just as noble things about you. 'Tis sweet to be
remembered. And I feel very anxious to do something
for all you children. This is the first time
we ever kept Christmas. We're going to make
you some Christmas presents. But they shall be
put in your stockings."</p>

<p>"I'll hang up my hip boots," interrupted
Samuel.</p>

<p>"I'll hang up my golf stockings," exclaimed
Henry.</p>

<p>"I'll hang my trousers; and you, Elizabeth, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
hang your bicycle bloomers." The Judge smiled,
and waited a moment, and then continued.
"These presents are different from the ordinary
gifts you receive. You'll have plenty of candy
and dolls and such things. We shall give you
things that you can always keep and carry with
you. And they will be worth more than money,
in case you use them according to directions.
And remember that we give them because we
have learned to love you, even if we do live in
pictures, and that we expect you will honor the
house, the people, and the State." The Judge
swallowed a tear. "We never had boys and girls
to go out into the world to make their mark.
Our two boys," and here the Judge's voice was
feeble and trembling, and he stopped for a moment
and wiped away two or three tears, "Our boys
were sick, and after quite a good many years they
went away forever. Children, I want you to fill
their places, and more. I expect that you will go
out into the world, and do so much good, and
serve your country with such zeal and wisdom, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
people will by and by come here to see the house,
and say, 'This is where Samuel and Henry, George
or Herbert, William, Nathaniel, or the "Little
Judge" lived, and were brought up.' Or 'This
was the childhood home of Elizabeth, Helen,
Miriam, Theodora, Grace, Ruth, Ethel, or Susie.
I wonder who slept in that room, and if this
was the favorite window, and which one of the
family planted this shrub or vine or tree, and what
was the best-loved play nook,' and all sorts of
questions. Don't you think it will be nice?
And then my wife and I will say, or try to say,
or make them understand in some way, that you
belonged to us next to belonging to your parents,
and that we guarded the house day and night,
for you know that in the picture we are always
awake; come into the east parlor at any hour of
the twenty-four and we always have our eyes
open, and we know everything that is going on.
We'll make them understand that a part of the
love and thanks they feel belongs to us, and
we shall be so happy, and when we meet again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
we shall have so many things to tell each other.
Now Ruth will see to the presents, for we are
not educated up to a belief in Santa Claus. Ruth
will"&mdash;Just at this point the clock began to
strike twelve.</p>

<p>Now, the Judge and his wife were the most
polite, really the best-mannered people in all
the world. But that striking of the clock seemed
to knock all the manners out of them. The
Judge sprang from the table quick as a flash,
and in his haste turned the clothes-basket with
the "Little Judge" in it bottom side up. Mrs.
"Judge" jumped up as spry as a girl, and ran
toward the Judge, who grabbed her by the hand,
and pushed her hard against the closets in the
way, and struggled to get into the hall.</p>

<p>There was the greatest confusion imaginable
in the house. The children were all hitting the
dishes, scattering the silver, overturning the
goblets, tumbling over the chairs. The closets
all made a rush for the door, and jammed themselves
so close together that Samuel and Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
had to raise the front windows, and jump out
on the piazza, and climb in at the parlor windows,
and the other children followed them pell-mell.
There was the greatest noise you ever heard in
a house. The clock sounded with terrific strikes.
The front door-bell, the dinner-bell, and all the
other bells rang an alarm. Things in the closets
seemed breaking themselves to pieces or going into
fits. The piano roared and shrieked like a hurricane.
Every board and brick and nail and bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
glass, metal, or wood squeaked or rattled. The
very carpets shook with dust and fear. And then,
as the children caught a glimpse of the Judge and
his wife back again in the portraits, the clock
struck the twelfth stroke, the lights all went out,
the children were back in bed, and silence reigned
throughout the old mansion.</p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">

<div class='drop-cap'>RUTH was the only one left
awake in the house. And it
was very lonesome for her.
But she had promised to distribute
the presents. Mrs.
"Judge" told her that the
man in the moon would bring them at twelve
o'clock, and that he would put them in Turpentine.</div>

<p>Ruth didn't like to go into the Judge's old study,
but that was where she would find Turpentine; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
she ran and got the baby, who had red hair, and
served the purpose of a light, and then she bravely
went into the far away part of the parsonage. She
took Satan, the cat, because his eyes were like coals
of fire, and helped to drive
away the darkness; and she
had Turk for company's sake.
The baby was soon astride his
back, crowing like a good fellow.</p>

</div>



<p>When they got into the old
study the light shone right
through the door that led into
Turpentine. It frightened
Ruth. She thought the house
might be on fire. But the
door swung open of itself; and
she and the baby, Satan and Turk, all entered.
The little room was a blaze of glory. She had to
put her hands up to her eyes and shade them, because
the light was so strong. It all came from a
row of packages arranged on the shelves. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
such a wonderful, mysterious, lovely sight you
never saw. The packages were various shapes and
sizes. They were all done up in nothing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
greatest care, and each was tied with a narrow
piece of something or other. Several packages
had strings of blue sky around them, ending in
curious bows. Three packages were tied with real
little rainbows. They were beautiful objects. The
rest of them had sunsets twisted about them,
gorgeous colors streaming from them in all directions.
Do you wonder that Ruth's eyes were
dazzled?</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/p187.png" width="459" height="600" alt="light shining out" />
</div>
<p>A singular thing about the packages was, that
being done up in nothing, and bound with such
tenuous and transparent stuff as blue sky, sunsets,
and rainbows, one could see straight through these
coverings and fastenings, and gaze upon the beautiful
things within. Each present had a label of
light above it. For instance, there were the shining
letters, S,A,M,U,E,L, worked upon the background
of darkness over the present for Samuel. The letters
seemed to hover above the package just as you
see light hover above children's heads in some pictures
of the old masters. So it was very easy for
Ruth to pick out the different gifts, and put them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
where they belonged. There were seventeen of
them. One for each child, one for the minister,
and one for his wife.</p>

<p>"How nice to remember father and mother!"
said Ruth to the dog, the cat, and the baby. "I
never thought of that. Now, how shall I carry
them?" For she felt that she would like to
show them to the Judge and his wife. So she
raised the window that connected this closet with
the parlor, and taking each gift, carried it to the
piano, and arranged the whole show where Mr.
and Mrs. "Judge" might see it from the pictures.
The baby, Turk, and Satan watched her while she
made the change. The parlor was warm; and just
as soon as she brought the marvellous presents into
the room, every nook and cranny was a perfect
splendor of brightness. "Dear me!" exclaimed the
child, "I must go up-stairs and get some colored
glasses or I shall lose my eyesight." She was
gone and back again in one minute and thirteen
seconds. The green goggles gave her a wise
and aged appearance, and she seemed to feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the importance of the occasion. "Here are the
presents, Judge." She was now addressing the
pictures. "They are just too sweet for anything.
How nice it is that I don't have to undo any of
them, but can look right straight through their
covers, and see what's in every package!" The
Judge and his wife were both wide awake, taking
in every word that Ruth spoke.</p>

<p>"Now, what is this for Samuel? A flower, I
do believe. He can wear it in his buttonhole.
Oh, how sweet and beautiful it is! The house
seems full of its sweetness. I love it." Ruth
bent over to kiss the airy, fragile thing. "Why,
here's a name under it, and a sentence. Did
you write it Judge?" And the picture seemed
to nod as much as to say "Yes." "Courtesy."
"To be worn all one's waking hours. It will
make the wearer welcome."</p>

<p>The next package was shaped round like a
ball. The bow on it was blue sky. "It looks
to me like a&mdash;what is it you call it, when you
look into a mirror? Oh! I've got it. It's a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
reflection. Now, that must be for Helen. Yes,
I see her name in fine letters of flame above.
H,E,L,E,N. You didn't send the curls, did you?"
Ruth looked anxiously at Mrs. "Judge." "I
suppose you thought that as Helen was going
to write a book she needed reflection more than
the curls."</p>

<p>The third package was long. The thing within
was long, and it looked like nothing that one
had ever seen.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" said Ruth to herself. As
she took it and felt of it, she found that it was
sensitive, yet quite firm. The object was pure
white, not a spot or wrinkle on it. The floating
label above the package spelled out the letters
H,E,R,B,E,R,T. Ruth read the name. "That
can't be backbone. It's too light for that. And
yet how strong it is. How in the world can he
ever get that inside of him where it belongs?"
The fourth package was about seven inches in
length, rather narrow, and larger at one end than
the other. "I do believe it's a spoon," shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Ruth. "It must be for Theodora. They've
found her gold spoon, and sent it to her. And
yet it doesn't look like gold. How funny! When
I feel of it I don't feel of anything. It isn't
so pretty as I thought it would be. It has a
kind of dull look. But how much better one
feels to hold it." Ruth had taken the curious
object in her hand, and was putting it up to her
lips, and going through various motions with it.
"Here is some writing. The spoon is marked.
What big letters they are! Theodora hasn't all
those initials. C,O,N,T,E,N,T,M,E,N,T. Well,
that beats me. But I suppose she'll know what
it means."</p>

<p>The child now picked up her own present.
They all seemed so bright and wonderful that
she had forgotten to choose her own first. Ruth's
package had a great many sides to it. Every
color imaginable appeared on the surface. It
was tied with several little rainbows, and there
were ever so many streamers and rosettes upon
it. She saw her name above; and she saw some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
letters printed into the leaves of the flower, for
it was a lovely, shining little blossom that was
contained within her package. It seemed to her
that all the colors of all the rainbows in the sky
had been woven into this matchless posey. There
were nine leaves to it, and each leaf was made up
of half a dozen shades of one or another color.
And then on each leaf there was distinctly seen
a letter done in diamond embroidery; so that the
light which shot forth from such delicate tracery
was almost as bright as the sun. One leaf had
S, a second E, a third N, a fourth T, a fifth I, a
sixth M, a seventh E, an eighth N, and the
ninth and last T. Ruth spelled it out carefully.
S,E,N,T,&mdash;here she paused and thought a moment.
"Why, to be sure!" she exclaimed; "it
has a very sweet scent. I think it smells quite
as good as Samuel's. But I told you, you remember"
(she was now addressing the pictures),
"that father said I needed sense. I'm afraid
he'll say that one 'sent' isn't enough." Then she
continued her spelling. "I, MENT. Well, now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
isn't that queer? 'I meant.'" She repeated it
several times. "I meant cent. Were you trying
to correct me, Judge? When I said sense did
I mean (what is it they call it), oh, singular, not
plural? Everybody says I've got a great deal
of imagination, but I lack (father says sense but
that isn't what I mean now)&mdash;I lack."... And
then Ruth looked at the flower again; and spelled
the word, and spoke it aloud. "'SENTIMENT,'
that's it. Sentiment. I know what it is. I
shall certainly be a poet. They all say so.
Thank you, dear Judge and Mrs. 'Judge.' I'm
going to begin to-morrow and write poetry. I
feel as if I could write some now. But I must
go through the presents and put them in the
children's stockings first." So Ruth put down
her package of "Sentiment," and examined the
other gifts.</p>

<p>She took the one marked H,E,N,R,Y into her
hands, and the room was filled with the most
heavenly music. The package was the shape of
a cylinder. It had a transparent cylinder within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
it. And this cylinder was written all over with
strange characters, exactly as you see or feel on
the cylinder of a graphophone. Only it didn't
seem to be made of anything, and when Ruth took
the object into her hands it was like holding a
pinch of air. It appeared to run of its own accord.
Ruth was enchanted with the melodies. They made
her think of everything good "in the heavens
above, and in the earth beneath, and in the waters
under the earth." She was so happy that she cried.
Every tear that she dropped went into the machine,
and made the music all the sweeter. Then
she read the words under the package. "Music in
the soul;" and she felt as if it were really stealing
into her, and as if it were impossible to keep
it there, and she must let this music in the soul go
in every direction.</p>

<p>"Isn't this lovely!" she exclaimed. "I never
dreamed music in the soul was so sweet. Why
Henry'll be the happiest boy in all the world."</p>

<p>Ruth then took into her hands a heart-shaped
package. It was tied up with a sunset that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
gorgeous with a great many shades of red. "I
know what's inside that package without looking,"
she said. Although of course she had looked, and
seen the form of the present, and noted the colors
used in tying it up. "That's a heart; and it's
for George. Isn't it cunning? Why, what a little
thing it is? and it's soft. Will this make George
soft-hearted and tender-hearted and good-hearted?
I hope so. It's real nice of you to send it."</p>

<p>The next present was for Elizabeth. It was
circular shape, like a small hoop; some parts of it
were light and some dark, some very beautiful
and some almost ugly. Yet the darkest, ugliest
spots upon it were illuminated and glorified by
brilliant flashes of what looked like lightning
playing around the hoop. When Ruth held the
object this singular brightness would flame up
into her face. It didn't hurt. It fascinated her.
She felt like sitting down and watching every
change. The words underneath the circle read,
"Experience is the best teacher." She spelled
it out, then her eyes beamed with delight. "It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the very thing that Elizabeth needs. I was afraid
you couldn't give it to her. I have heard it was
hard to pass on experience to other people. Now
Elizabeth can run the house and mother can travel.
That will be real jolly."</p>

<p>"Here is something for Susie," cried Ruth, as
she put down Elizabeth's package, and took up the
next one. "It's a cup made of&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;why,
isn't that queer?&mdash;made of wishes. This is the
first time I ever really saw a wish. Now, Susie
always teases for the wish-bone. And here's a
cup made, not of wish-bones, but of wishes. I wonder
if she can drink out of it. She's always telling
how 'thursday' she is. We're sometimes
afraid she'll drink the well dry. Why, the cup is
full of something. It sparkles. 'A Draught of
Bliss.' That's what it says under the cup. I know
what that means. It means to feel as good as
one can feel. Well, I'm glad she's going to have it.
If the cup spills over we'll catch some of the drops.
And if she feels good we'll all feel better." Thus
wisely remarked the child to the pictures.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The next package had a dream wrapped up in it.
You never saw anything more curious. It was as
light as a feather, as bright as a button, as sweet
as a rose, as gay as a lark, as true as steel, as deep
as the sea, as high as heaven, as wise as an owl,
as you like it. It had all the hues of the rainbow.
It was as odd as Dick's hatband. It went floating
against the blue sky. It dipped down into
several sunsets as you see swallows dip down or
fly up when a storm is coming. It seemed well
suited to Nathaniel, the humming-bird sort of a
boy. And there were the letters in shotted light
over against the gloom, N,A,T,H,A,N,I,E,L.</p>

<p>"Dear little Nathaniel," said Ruth, as she
handled the dream carefully, putting it back in
its wrappings of nothing, and tying it up again
with blue sky, sunsets, and rainbows all mixed
together. "Won't he be surprised to see a real
dream, and carry it all around town to show folks.
And it's a good dream, a nice dream, I know. I
can tell by touching it and feeling of it all over."</p>

<p>The next package was a large one; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
for Grace, although she was not one of the largest
girls. It was shaped like a triangle, and when
you took hold of it the thing seemed to stretch
bigger and bigger. "What can it be, I wonder,"
mused Ruth. And then looking keenly through
the nothing that covered it, she discovered that
there were a great many little, charming, luminous
objects packed into the package. They were
different shapes and colors and sizes. But every
one of them was pleasant to the touch, alluring
to the eye, and melodious to the ear. Whether
each one contained a music-box or not, it was
impossible to say, but strains of angelic songs
kept escaping. It reminded Ruth of Henry's
"Music in the Soul." Underneath the triangular
box she read these words: "A fine Assortment
of Generous Impulses. Warranted Pure." The
big words she skipped, except the two, generous
impulses. She knew them at once, for she had
heard her father say a great deal on that subject.</p>

<p>"Judge, it's very good of you to send these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
dear, blessed things to Grace. I'm perfectly sure
she'll divide up and give every one of us as many
as we like. I should think there might be a
hundred in the box. I'm a-going to climb right
up here on the piano and kiss both of you."
And she did; and she carried the generous impulses
with her when she did it.</p>

<p>When Ruth jumped down on the floor again she
examined Miriam's package. It held a star, a
real star. The man in the moon brought it down
from the sky.</p>

<p>"Isn't this wonderful beyond anything!" exclaimed
the child. "How many times we've said
'Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what
you are,' and now here you are." The little,
shrewd, cunning fellow sparkled and glistened
so that Ruth's eyes ached in spite of her green
goggles. He seemed a very intelligent creature.
He could almost talk.</p>

<p>"I heard father say something about plucking
the stars from heaven the other day, and then he
repeated something about the stars growing cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
This star isn't cold, I know. And there's his
name down at the bottom. 'A Star of Hope.'
Hope so. Now Miriam will be proud enough.
We shall see her going around with her star.
I've heard about babies being born under some
star or other. I see now how they could get
under. Judge, will Miriam be a star herself now?
Do you think she will star it? 'Star of Hope.'
This beats me."</p>

<p>Ethel's present was next. The package was
so bright that it was impossible to tell the shape
of it. From every direction the light rayed forth
in dazzling brilliancy.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it is a box of glory," cried Ruth.
The writing underneath the shining, beautiful
thing said "Sunshine."</p>

<p>"Haven't we been singing 'Rise, Shine?' How
lovely it will be to have Ethel go about the
house scattering sunshine! What strange stuff it
is!" As she said this Ruth took a handful of it
out of the package and examined it very closely.
"It keeps slipping out of the hands and dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
down to the floor or rising up to the wall. Dear
me! how shall I get it back?" She chased it
in ten ways at the same time. "But I can't
catch it," she continued; "and see, there is quite
as much of it left as there was in my hands
and the box before it floated away. Oh! won't
this be nice on rainy days? We can have the
house filled with sunshine, even if it does rain,
and the sky is black with clouds. I do think I
never saw such elegant, wonderful presents in
all my life, and I don't believe any other children
in all this world ever got such things as
we have for our Christmas."</p>

<p>The next present was for William. As Ruth
looked at it she seemed lost in thought. She
was studying it out. There wasn't any shape to
the thing. The package itself didn't have any
shape. It was a beautiful mass of light. Yet the
longer you looked at it, the more lovely, attractive,
and real it appeared. Finally it did take a
shape; and when you made up your mind that it
was round or square or octagonal or irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
or something else, the shapeliness of the thing
vanished.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it's a thought?" the child said
to herself. "I've often thought I'd like to see
what a thought looks like. I hear so much about
thought and thoughts, that I'm real curious.
Father told mother the other day that I was a
very thoughtful child. If I'm thought<em>ful</em>, seems
to me I ought to see a good many or feel 'em."
Then she looked down under the package, and
read, "A Bundle of I,D,E,A,L,S."</p>

<p>"Why, I don't see any bundle," she exclaimed.
But that moment the mass of light changed into
strands of willowy brightness, and she could see
there was a neat little bundle of these shining
threads. She took the bundle into her hands and
pulled out one. This first strand was straight
as an arrow, and there suddenly showed itself
at the bottom of it a chain of letters. The strand
of splendor, in fact, appeared to grow out of these
letters. They were M,A,N,L,I,N,E,S,S. The letters
were made in quaint forms, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
indescribably beautiful. Ruth pulled out another
strand from the bundle. This seemed larger and
more solid than the first, and quite as precious.
Letters soon formed into a chain at the lower
end, and these were W,O,R,T,H. She pulled out
the third strand. It seemed almost alive, being
in constant motion. The chain of letters beneath
it was as follows: S,E,R,V,I,C,E. A fourth
strand had the letters H,O,N,O,R entwined about
one end. And there were many other similar
strands. Ruth had on her thinking-cap (made
of nothing particular, and trimmed with everything
in general) all the time that she was examining
them. Of a sudden the word "Ideals"
struck her.</p>

<p>"I know now what these bright, lovely things
are," she cried. "I've heard father preach about
them, and he has told us children I think
hundreds of times. He says we must all have
them, and have the best too. Why didn't you
think of it before? Judge, you're just as good as
you can be." Ruth was talking to the pictures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
"Father and mother will be very thankful that
you have brought all these into the family. I
know what an Ideal is. It's what you want to
be, and try to be. Haven't I heard Samuel and
Elizabeth and the older ones talk about high
ideals?" As she spoke she shook the radiant
little bundle, and saw all sorts of great, noble men
and fine, lovely women spring right out of the
brightness, taking form before her face and eyes.
"I do declare that looks like William." She
was gazing at one of the tiny, luminous faces
that appeared against the shadows. "We shall
all pop into the light like that, I expect. That
must be what father calls attaining one's Ideal.
Isn't it grand? Yes, there come the other children.
One springs out of one Ideal, and another
out of another. It's just like a fairy tale. But I
never dreamed what curious things Ideals were.
How rich we shall be?" Then Ruth gathered
the Ideals together, and put them back where
she found them.</p>

<p>The next present was for her mother. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
resting on an air-cushion in a casket of love. It
seemed to Ruth that the sun and moon and a good
many stars had got into that package. It took
more rainbows than you can shake a stick at to
tie up the package securely, so that nothing could
get to it. The present was a crown, and underneath
were the words "A Mother's Jewels." There
were fifteen of them, no two alike. The crown
was a cloud with a silver lining. Ruth took it in
her hands, and putting it on her head, felt the
light running all down her head and over her
face. It wasn't the least bit uncomfortable. But
the top of the crown was the most wonderful.
All the fifteen jewels studded it, so that, as one
wore it, anybody standing by would almost think
that the brightest lights in the heavens had been
borrowed, and wrought into this head-dress. And
each jewel had a name all about it, the letters
being made of the very smallest stars that you
can find out of doors. The child was too astonished
and delighted to talk as she examined this
gift. She put it back in its casket without one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
word. It took her breath away, so that she couldn't
say anything.</p>

<p>By the side of this package was one for her
father. She was glad to turn to it, for it was not
so splendid and marvellous that it dumfounded
her. His package had a bottle in it.</p>

<p>"I believe it's made of forget-me-nots," said
Ruth. She took it into her hands, and found it was
woven like basket work, a sort of wicker bottle.
Only the stems of the plants were so intertwisted
that the blossoms all came to the outside. But
both stems and blossoms were perfectly transparent,
so you could see straight through into
the inside. "E,S,S,E,N,C,E of C,H,E,E,R,F,U,L,N,E,S,S.
To be taken eternally." This was
written beneath, and Ruth spelled the two big
words slowly. "I know what that means," she
continued. "The Judge is going to give father
some more sense. For essence, of course, is only
another kind of sense. Oh! I forgot the essence
man. He brings us peppermint and vanilla and
cologne. We season things, and make ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
smell good. Now, that's what you've sent to
father, isn't it? Essence of Cheerfulness. You
want him to season things with cheerfulness, don't
you, and make himself and all the rest of us fragrant?
And he'll do it. He's always saying that
we ought to be cheerful. But what kind of stuff
is it?" and Ruth tipped up the bottle to taste of
its contents. She smacked her lips and beamed
with delight. "I do believe it's a spirit. Father
says, you can't see spirit but you can feel it. I
can't see anything but light in that bottle, but I
can feel something all through me. I must dance
a little, I feel so good. Oh, dear me! that's the
way people sometimes act when they've drunk
from bad bottles. But I can't help it." She
caught her skirts in each hand, and airily waltzed
up and down the room.</p>

<p>"I must see if the mantle is here," she suddenly
exclaimed. "How strange that I've just thought
of it!" And then she stopped to look at the
baby's present.</p>

<p>"It can't be that the Judge's mantle would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
go into such a little package as that." So Ruth
remarked as she took the tiny thing in hand. It
was tied with the most brilliant sunset that eyes
ever saw. The streamers attached to the bow
were much bigger than the package itself. When
Ruth undid it, and held the singular object before
her eyes, it seemed to grow large and long. It
was truly the Judge's mantle. As she shook it out,
and let its folds drop down to the floor, the pictures
fairly beamed with glory. "Silver threads
among the gold," exclaimed the child, as the beauteous
garment flashed its splendors into her eyes.
For the warp was the pure gold of character, while
the woof was the fine silver of influence. And
they were woven into a fabric of surpassing richness.
Then this matchless weaving was covered
with fairest embroidery. Every color that imagination
ever conceived appeared upon the garment.
There was the white light of truth, the red of
sacrifice, the purple of royalty, the greens of fresh
life, the pink of propriety, the red that you see
in a green blackberry, the blue of a minister's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Monday, and true blue, auburn from a child's head,
hazel from a child's eyes, black as thunder cloud,
pale as death, the lemon of lemon ice, orange
from orangeade, and a great many others. And
these colors were worked into words, flowers of
rhetoric, scenes indeed, pictures of love, kindness,
wisdom, and peace. It was also adorned with
quite a number of gems of poetry, and it had a
pearl of great price to fasten it at the throat.</p>

<p>The first thing which Ruth did was to try it
on, but it dragged on the floor. It occurred to her
that the baby must wait until he was grown up
before it fitted him. Still, she tried it on the
baby. No sooner did she wrap it around him
than it seemed to shrink to his size.</p>

<p>"Why, we can use it for a winter coat," she
said. And the "Little Judge," who had fallen
asleep before the fire, where he had crawled with
Turk and the cat, cooed and laughed when the
mantle was wrapped about him, seeming to feel
that it was the very thing that would make him
happy and comfortable. All the time that Ruth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was handling the magic thing, it continued to
throw off little points of light and countless mites
of color, and these settled down on the furniture
and carpet and the curtains and the walls and
the ceiling, until the room was like a palace
studded with twinkling, shifting, radiant stars;
and every present on the piano was shining and
scattering light, the air being filled with music,
and Ruth was wild with delight and excitement.</p>

<p>The next thing was to carry the gifts to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
stockings where they belonged. Wherever she
went, there was the brightness of noonday, so she
never had a fear. Even the closet with the skeleton
in it did not make her tremble. Beginning
with father and mother, she visited every stocking,
and put each gift in its proper place; then she
carried the baby to bed, and left Turk and Satan
snuggled up together in front of the fire; and then
it seemed to her that she floated away in a sea
of light; and then mounting upon the wings of
the wind, she suddenly met the sand man who
pushed her into the Land of Nod.</p>

<p>The last that she remembered was blue sky,
gems of poetry, rainbows, shooting stars, flowers
of rhetoric, strains of music, sunsets, closets, stockings,
Christmas cheer, sunshine, and a great many
other things, all standing around the type-writer in
her father's study, telling the machine what to say,
and begging that everything might be set down in
a book and live forever.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='smcap'>Now</span>, when it grew toward morning Ruth awakened
first, and what did she do but jump out of
bed and feel of her stocking; the thing which she
found was a book, and she knew without looking
into it that the book told all about the Judge
and the pictures, the house and the children, and
the strange things that had happened on this
eventful night.</p>

<p>Later there was the sound of many voices, scores
of "I wish you a merry Christmas," went flying
through the air, carols burst upon the ear, and a
whole host of happy, loving children shifted from
one room to another, and finally gathered beneath
the pictures of the Judge and his lady. Did the
good man lift his hands in benediction? Did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
he beam with the joy of the Christ-life? The
light was rather dim in the parlor, for it was early
in the morning. But the children were constantly
turning their eyes to the portraits. It seemed to
them that new life throbbed within their souls,
that grand purposes had been awakened, that
charity and tenderness, the love of God and the
love of one another, were moving to all kinds of
well-doing. They felt as never before that they
were living in the home of this great, good man,
and that they must go forth into the world as his
manly and womanly representatives. Peace not
only filled the house, but it rested upon them. It
was the most joyful day of all the years. Never
a quarrel darkened a heart. Never a harsh word
fell from any lips. Never a mean thought rose
in their breasts. It was real Christmas cheer.
And I believe that every child of them was
made richer by the blessed presence (presents)
of the Judge and his lady.</p>
